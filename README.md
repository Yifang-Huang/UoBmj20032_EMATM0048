There are three parts in the coursework. For the first and third part, I created folders named part1 and part 3 to upload. The code of the second part is in part 2.ipynb file. The file format of the python files in part1 folder is .py. The explanation of the functions in the first part is in the comment above each function. The format of code file in the second and third part is .ipython that need to be opened with Jupyter Notebook. The python files in part 3 folders and part 2.ipython contain the code and explanation in markdown. There is also a bbcnew.csv file in part 3 folder wich needs to be opened in Microsoft Excel.
