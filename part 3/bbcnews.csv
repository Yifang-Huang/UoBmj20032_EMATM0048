Capitol riots: FBI warnings amid fears of more pro-Trump violence," The FBI is warning of the possibility of armed protests being held across the US in the days before Joe Biden is sworn in as president.  There are reports of armed groups planning to gather at all 50 state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to his 20 January inauguration. The fears come as security plans are hardened for the event itself. On Monday, Mr Biden told reporters he was not afraid to take the oath of office outside of the US Capitol. Both he and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to be sworn in outside the building, only two weeks after it was the site of a deadly raid by radical supporters of President Donald Trump opposing the election result. Security officials are resolute there will be no repeat of the breach seen on 6 January - when thousands of pro-Trump supporters were able to break into the grounds of the complex where members of Congress were voting to certify the election result.  What is the 25th Amendment?The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol  Capitol riots: What's happening with arrests? Chad Wolf, acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, said Monday that he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin special operations for the inauguration on Wednesday - six days early - ""in light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape"".  Officials say up to 15,000 National Guard troops could be made available to fortify the event. Later on Monday, Mr Wolf became the third Trump cabinet secretary to step down since the Capitol riots, after Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao. Mr Wolf's exit plunged his department into turmoil just as it gears up to handle security for the Biden inauguration. Mr Wolf last week called on Mr Trump to ""strongly condemn"" the protesters who stormed Congress. The outgoing secretary said his departure had been prompted by ""recent events"", including court rulings challenging the legal validity of his appointment. Law enforcement around the country are said to be bracing for the possibility of further violence in the days before Joe Biden takes office.  Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on 17 January and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself.    An internal FBI bulletin, reported by ABC News and other outlets, carries a warning that one group is calling for the ""storming"" of state, local and federal courthouses around the country if Mr Trump is removed from office early and on inauguration day if he is not.  Calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots. Local police agencies have been told by federal law enforcement to increase security at statehouses following last week's violence, according to US media.  The Reuters news agency, citing a federal law enforcement official, said the FBI warnings are in place for all state capitals from 16 to 20 January itself and in Washington DC at least three days before the inauguration.  Although the violence at the US Capitol dominated headlines last week, similar smaller incidents were reported elsewhere in the country at the same time. The US Department of Homeland Security confirmed on Monday that it would begin National Special Security Event (NSSE) operations for the inauguration six days early, starting Wednesday. The designation allows a wide range of security and law enforcement agencies to coordinate together on special protective measures, like enforcing road closures and a secure perimeter. The announcement came after Washington DC's Mayor, Ms Bowser, went public with her appeal to bolster security after what she described as an ""unprecedented terrorist attack"" at the US Capitol last week. She has also asked Americans to avoid travel to Washington DC for the event. Inaugurations traditionally draw hundreds of thousands to the streets of the capital, but the coronavirus pandemic had already curtailed those plans before security fears were heightened.  Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero'Democrats move to impeach Trump again The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, said Monday that 10,000 troops will be in Washington DC by the weekend, with about 5,000 more available if requested by local officials. Elsewhere, the National Park Service announced that it has closed the Washington Monument to visitors amid ""credible threats"" of further violence.   ""Groups involved in the January 6 2021 riots at the US Capitol continue to threaten to disrupt the 59th presidential inauguration on January 20,"" the service said in a statement, adding it could institute further temporary closures to other areas within the National Mall and Memorial Parks.  Speaking as he got his second Covid-19 vaccine on Monday, Mr Biden said he was ""not afraid"" to take his oath of office outside despite security fears. His inauguration committee has announced that the ceremony will be themed around ""America United"".  After being sworn in as president, Mr Biden is expected to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside former presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton to help underscore his message of unity.  Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration - becoming the first president in more than 150 years not to do so. The warnings about further pro-Trump violence come as efforts move forward to impeach the president for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol. An article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"" during a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was ""stolen"" from him.  Democrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. Mr Trump has made no public statements since he was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter - on Friday. It comes as websites and social media networks crackdown against other users and websites seen to be encouraging violence - including social network Parler, which said Monday it was suing Amazon for removing it from its web hosting service.

Trump impeachment move: Democrats start push to oust US president," Democrats have introduced an article of impeachment against US President Donald Trump for his role in last week's deadly invasion of the Capitol. The article filed in the House on Monday accuses Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"". Democrats say a vote on the article will go ahead in the House on Wednesday unless Vice-President Mike Pence invokes constitutional powers to remove Mr Trump from office. Mr Pence is said to oppose the idea. ""The president represents an imminent threat to our constitution, our country and the American people, and he must be removed from office immediately,"" Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Calls for Mr Trump's resignation, removal from office or impeachment have grown among Democrats and some Republicans in the days following the riots in Congress in which five people died. The impeachment resolution accuses the president of encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol building at a rally in which Mr Trump alleged, without evidence, that November's presidential election was ""stolen"" from him. The White House has dismissed the impeachment threat as ""politically motivated"", but Mr Trump has made no public statements since he was banned from several social media platforms - including Twitter - on Friday. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. Mr Trump has said he will not attend Mr Biden's swearing-in ceremony. What is the 25th Amendment?The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol  'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots This is the second time Democrats have pursued impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress. In December 2019, the House impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020. No US president has ever been impeached twice. However, the prospect of an impeachment conviction is unlikely because of Mr Trump's broad Republican support in the Senate. The resolution drafted by three Democrats - who began writing it while under lockdown in the Capitol last Wednesday - consists of one article: ""Incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the resolution reads. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter In the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". The resolution also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Biden's election win. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,"" the resolution says. Impeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which holds a trial to decide whether to convict or not. There is no appeal against outcome. An impeachment is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one. Mr Trump was the third US president to be impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were also left in office by the Senate. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached in 1974, as political pressure built over the Watergate scandal. On Monday, the Democrats presented a resolution to formally request that Mr Pence invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president and the cabinet to declare Mr Trump unfit for office. The resolution urged Mr Pence to ""declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the president is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office"". But, as expected, the resolution was not adopted by unanimous consent in the House, after Republican Alex Mooney of West Virginia objected to the request. The House has now gone into recess until Tuesday morning, when the chamber is expected to vote on the resolution. After the vote, the Democrats said they will give Mr Pence 24 hours to remove Mr Trump from office before they move toward impeachment. ""The president's threat to America is urgent, and so too will be our action,"" Speaker Pelosi said. Although Mr Pence has appeared to distance himself from the president, there is no sign that the vice-president is prepared to invoke the amendment. Impeachments are usually long, drawn-out affairs, involving investigations and hearings that can take weeks to conclude. This impeachment is expected to be much quicker.  Monday's presentation of the impeachment article to the House paves the way for a vote to be held. A simple majority in favour of impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Senate. However, an internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires. The Senate is currently not in session, and all 100 senators would have to agree to change the schedule, which is highly unlikely. Constitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial when Mr Trump leaves office. But Democrats appear confident that the House can impeach Mr Trump and send the articles to the Senate for a trial at a later date. On Sunday, Democratic House whip James Clyburn said the party may not send any articles to the Senate for trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office. It's a new week in Washington DC, but the fallout from Wednesday's tragic events are just beginning.   With only eight days left of Mr Trump's presidency, Democrats are very aware of the disruption an impeachment and a Senate trial would cause to the early days of Mr Biden's administration. That's why there is talk of delaying Mr Trump's Senate trial until after Mr Biden's first 100 days in office.  At that point, the pressure to remove Mr Trump will be past, but other punishments - stripping him of the accommodations and privileges ex-presidents enjoy and prohibiting him from future federal office - still apply. A year ago, Senate Republicans voted as a block to acquit the president of impeachment charges. This time, however, there may be some willing to side with Democrats to make sure that Trump, once out of power, never returns again.",BBC News - World,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:39:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55622326
Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman hailed as 'a hero'," A US Capitol police officer is being called a hero for singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chambers during the deadly riots.  Footage of the officer, identified as Eugene Goodman, shows him just steps ahead of rioters as they chase him up a flight of stairs.  Mr Goodman is then seen glancing towards the Senate entrance before luring the men in the opposite direction.  Five people, including a police officer, died as a result of the riots. FBI to probe officer's death during pro-Trump riotQuestions mount over US Capitol security failure Another officer who was on duty during the siege died by suicide this weekend, his family said.  The show of bravery from Mr Goodman, reportedly an Army veteran who spent time in Iraq, comes amid criticism of Capitol Police for apparent security failures during the storming of the Capitol.  On Monday night, the department said two of its officers had been suspended and more than a dozen others were under investigation for suspected inappropriate involvement with the rioters. New York Law School criminal law professor and 20-year veteran of the New York City Police Department Kirk Burkhalter called Mr Goodman's response to rioters ""tremendous"". ""I don't think there was any type of training that would prepare you for that situation,"" Mr Burkhalter said.  In the video shot by Huffington Post reporter Igor Bobic, Mr Goodman, who is black, is antagonised by the group of Trump supporters - who are all white men.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The man at the front of the pack, wearing a QAnon T-shirt, has been identified as Doug Jensen of Iowa. He was later arrested by local police and the FBI for his role in the riots.  Footage shows Mr Jensen leading the mob that chased Mr Goodman up a flight of stairs - just a few feet away from the entrance to the Senate floor. As he is pursued, Mr Goodman shouts ""second floor!"" into his radio, seemingly alerting other officers of the group approaching the chamber.  After Mr Goodman glances toward the Senate chamber entrance, he shoves Mr Jensen - a move seemingly designed to draw attention on to himself, luring the mob away from the chambers and those hiding inside.  The image of Mr Goodman trailed by a mob - some armed with Confederate flags, others with allusions to the Nazi flag - was  extremely disturbing, Mr Burkhalter said.  ""Police officer, not a police officer, to see a black man being chased by someone carrying a Confederate flag - there is something wrong with that picture. That should never happen again,"" he said.  ""It just reeks of everything we need to correct.""   Officer Goodman has been celebrated by several members of Congress, with some calling for Mr Goodman to be awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his service.  ""As Trump's fascist mob ransacked the US Capitol, this brave USCP officer kept murderous rioters away from the Senate chamber and saved the lives of those inside,"" wrote congressman Bill Pascal on Twitter.  ""Last Wednesday, I was inside the Senate chamber when Officer Eugene Goodman led an angry mob away from it at great personal risk. His quick thinking and decisive action that day likely saved lives, and we owe him a debt of gratitude,"" wrote Senator Bob Casey on Monday.  Mr Goodman's standoff with the mob came just minutes before authorities were able to seal the chamber, according to reporting from the Washington Post. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Members of the 2,000-person Capitol police department are tasked with protecting the Capitol building and those inside, it. They are separate from DC police, who patrol the rest of the city.  The chief of the Capitol Police, Steven Sund, resigned last week following criticism over his force's response to the riots, including a public call from top Democrat Nancy Pelosi for Mr Sund to step down.  Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin has said that the Justice Department will consider pursuing criminal charges against any Capitol police officers found to be complicit with the rioters.  Officer Howard Liebengood, 51, who was on duty during the riots, died by suicide on Saturday, his family has said. A lawyer for Mr Liebengood's family called the 15-year department veteran's death a ""devastating loss"".  On Twitter, Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he and his team were ""heartbroken"" over Mr Liebengood's death. ""Howie was a familiar and cheerful presence, and also a friend to me and my staff,"" Mr Romney wrote. ""His bravery, kindness, and genuine care for others was deeply felt by all of us who had the privilege of knowing him.""  According to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the Capitol police force has responded to a number of incidents of officers threatening to harm themselves after last week's attacks.  Mr Burkhalter said that responsibility for any security breakdowns rests with the department's leadership.  When you get to the place where individual police officers, like Officer Goodman, have to make decisions on the deployment of resources, the battle has been lost, he said. ""It should never have gotten to that point,"" he said. ",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 03:06:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55623752
Cuba placed back on US terrorism sponsor list," The US has placed Cuba back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, citing the communist country's backing of Venezuela. President Donald Trump's administration made the announcement just days before he leaves the White House. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on 20 January, has previously said he wants to improve US-Cuban relations. Cuba called the move ""political opportunism"". Mr Biden has said he is seeking closer ties between the long-term adversaries but Mr Trump's decision is likely to hinder a quick repair of relations.  Cuba's place on the list will require a formal review that could take months, analysts say. The Caribbean island was removed from the list by President Barack Obama in 2015, but Mr Trump has taken a harder line towards the country. What Biden's victory means for the rest of the worldKey moments explaining tense Cuba-US relationshipThe man who saved Old Havana from decay When explaining the decision, officials cited Cuba's support of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro who the US refuses to recognise. ""With this action, we will once again hold Cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of US justice,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Monday. In response, Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez tweeted: ""We condemn the cynical and hypocritical qualification of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, announced by the United States."" In advance of the announcement, House Democrat Gregory Meeks called it ""another stunt by President Trump and Pompeo, trying to tie the hands of the incoming Biden administration on their way out the door."" Mr Biden's plans included allowing Cuban-Americans to visit family and send money.  President Obama normalised relations with Cuba in 2015. He called the decades-long US efforts to isolate the country ""a failure"". Since the Cold War era, the US had pursued various policies to undermine Cuba which it saw as a great threat. Cuba now rejoins countries including Iran and North Korea on the list of sponsors of terrorism. The impact on the island country include severe limits on foreign investment.",BBC News - World,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 23:47:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-55627032

Bill Belichick: NFL coach turns down Presidential Medal of Freedom," Top NFL coach Bill Belichick says he will not accept President Donald Trump's offer of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing the US Capitol riot. Belichick, of the New England Patriots, said he was flattered when he was first offered the medal - the top award given to civilians in the US. But he said he changed his mind after a mob of Trump supporters stormed Congress last week. Five people died. The celebrated coach had previously spoken of his friendship with Mr Trump. ""Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honour represents and admiration for prior recipients,"" Belichick said in a statement.  ""Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.""  Belichick, who has won a record six Super Bowl titles, is considered one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. The Presidential Medal of Freedom recognises individuals who have made outstanding contributions to ""the security or national interests of America"". In 2019 Mr Trump gave the award to golfer Tiger Woods, as well as radio personality Rush Limbaugh and posthumously Elvis Presley.",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 02:23:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55627873
Brexit: UK driver has ham sandwiches confiscated at Dutch border," A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules. The officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU. Under EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products. The rules appeared to bemuse one driver. ""Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,"" a Dutch border official told the driver in footage broadcast by TV network NPO 1. In one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them.  When the driver said they did, the border official said: ""Okay, so we take them all."" Surprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: ""No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry."" The UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020. From 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force. A trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement. The UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods. Boris Johnson hails free trade deal with EUWhat are the key points of the Brexit deal?Are the borders ready? The UK government has issued guidance to commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to ""be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports"". ""You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,"" the guidance says. ""There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed."" On its website, the European Commission says the ban is necessary because such goods ""continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union"". ""It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,"" the Commission says. Separately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland.  ""Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,"" the agency said. ""So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up."" The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as ""a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal"".

Pope Francis backs women's roles in Catholic services," Pope Francis has formally changed the law in the Roman Catholic Church, allowing women to administer communion and serve at the altar. But the ordained priesthood will still be the preserve of men, he stressed in the decree. It is official recognition of roles already performed by women in some Catholic services, especially in Western countries. The Pope said women were making a ""precious contribution"" to the Church. The announcement is expected to force conservative Church leaders to accept greater involvement of women in the liturgy. On the more reformist wing of the Church, Pope Francis has tried to present a more welcoming image through his rhetoric, the BBC's Mark Lowen reports from Rome.  But last year, after a synod to decide whether to allow women to become deacons able to preside over some Church services, the Pope refused to make the change, frustrating some who had hoped for more fundamental reform during his pontificate. The Pope changed a clause in canon law from ""lay men"" to ""lay persons"", specifying that they can perform ""the ministries of lector and acolyte"" in Catholic services. His decree, called a Spiritus Domini, was accompanied by a letter explaining ""the urgency... to rediscover the co-responsibility of all of the baptised in the Church, and the mission of the laity in a particular way"". A lector in the Catholic Church can recite prayers and sacred texts such as psalms during Mass and other services, but gospel readings are done by the priest or deacon. An acolyte assists the priest or deacon at the altar and can distribute the Eucharist - the symbolic bread and wine - during Mass.

California prison break: Six inmates on run after improvised rope escape," Six inmates are on the run after breaking out of a California jail in the United States over the weekend using an improvised rope. Dozens of investigators are scouring the region looking for them.  Law enforcement officials warned the public that they should be considered ""armed and dangerous"". One of them was being held on a murder charge. The jail break happened late on Saturday night, according to Merced County Sheriff Vernon Warnke.  The fugitives are thought to have managed to get on to the roof of Merced County Downtown Jail in central California and used braided sheets to escape. But guards did not realise the men were missing until the next morning. The inmates include Fabian Cruz Roman, 22, who is charged with murder, and Andres Nunez Rodriguez, 21, and Gabriel Francis Coronado, 19, who are both charged with attempted murder. ""They're not going to be out there trying to sell Girl Scout Cookies. They're going to try and get away from this area, I believe, as fast as they can,"" Mr Warnke said. The sheriff has assembled a taskforce to try to track them down.

Sri Lanka: Tamil war monument to be rebuilt after hunger strike," A monument in Sri Lanka to commemorate the tens of thousands of Tamils who died in the civil war is to be rebuilt following a hunger strike by students protesting at its demolition. The memorial to Tamils who lost their lives in Mullivaikkal was demolished at Jaffna University last week. The University Grants Commission (UGC) had said that the monument was a threat to unity in the country. But angry students protested and went on hunger strike over its demolition. Now the monument is to be rebuilt, said the university's vice-chancellor, who laid a foundation stone on Monday. The monument was built in 2019 in memory of Tamils who lost their lives in the 26-year civil war between government forces and the Tamil Tiger rebel group.  Tens of thousands of minority Tamils died in Mullivaikkal in 2009 during the final stages of the war, which claimed an estimated 100,000 lives. The monument was knocked down on Friday, with UGC Chairman Sampath Amaratunge saying it was a threat to national unity in Sinhalese majority Sri Lanka. Public Security Minister Sarath Weerasekera said that ""no one will and should be allowed to commemorate dead terrorists"". In response, students started protesting at the university gates and some went on hunger strike, calling for the monument to be restored. There were threats of a general strike in areas where Tamils are a majority.  Sri Lanka's war 10 years on: Finding Father FrancisMass grave: Dozens of skeletons found in MannarThe broken survivors of Sri Lanka's civil war ""This act is an insult not only to the university students but also to the entire Tamil people. It is also an act of denial of a people's right to memory,"" the university's students' union said in a statement. Union leader Pakianathan Uyanthan told BBC Tamil's Arun Prasad in Jaffna: ""We have the right to mourn for our loved ones, who perished in the war. These people sacrificed their lives for the Tamil community. ""We are extremely pained by the demolition of this monument."" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter One of the strikers fell ill over the weekend, the Tamil Guardian reported. There was a backlash internationally, too, particularly in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In Toronto, Tamil Canadians held a car rally to condemn the destruction. The monument is now to be restored. The university's vice chancellor, S Srisatkunarajah, met the hunger strikers early on Monday and gave each of them a cup of porridge to end their protest. Mr Srisatkunarajah told the BBC that a new ""peace monument"" would be erected in the same location. He said he had been ""blamed for the demolition"", adding that the monument was removed as it had not been authorised.  A student at the university, Dwakaran, said the announcement of the new monument meant protests had been suspended. ""But if the memorial is not built again we will resume our protest,"" the student said. It is as yet unclear whether formal permission has been granted by the central government or the UGC to build the new monument, but the Tamil Guardian reported the vice chancellor saying the rebuilding was taking place on the government's orders. After finishing the ceremony, the Sri Lankan police attempted to make students write down their personal details as they left, the newspaper reported. When the students refused, the police reportedly said it was due to coronavirus guidelines. All students were allowed to leave after Mr Srisatkunarajah intervened, it said.  The Tamil Tigers controlled around a third of Sri Lanka before they were crushed in 2009. Sri Lanka's current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the country's defence secretary then and played a leading role in crushing the rebels. He is hailed as a hero by many in the Sinhalese population but deeply distrusted by the Tamil community, many of whom accuse the government of denying them the right to remember their war dead.",BBC News - World,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:08:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55620079
Sriwijaya Air crash: Indonesia divers search wreckage as black box hunt resumes," The Indonesian navy has released footage of divers searching through the wreckage of a passenger plane which crashed into the sea at the weekend as the hunt for its black boxes resumes.  Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 left Jakarta with 62 people on board, but vanished from the radar on its way to Borneo island on Saturday. Search teams have found aircraft parts and human remains and believe they know where the black boxes are located. The first victim has been identified. Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant on the plane, was identified by his fingerprints, officials said late on Monday. 'Kind' pilot and newly-weds among air crash missingIndonesia crashed plane's 'black boxes' locatedAir disasters timeline One official stressed the urgency of the search mission calling it a ""24-hour"" operation.  ""It's going to be an around-the-clock operation,"" Rasman MS, head of the search and rescue agency's crash operations told reporters.  ""There will be no breaks. The sooner we can find the victims, the better.""  According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel are currently involved in the search operation along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Divers have been recovering body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing from waters about 23 metres (75ft) deep.  There appears to be no hope of finding any survivors. Navy chief of staff Yudo Margono said the search team had pinpointed the location of the black box cockpit voice and flight data recorders and a remote-controlled vehicle was being used to scan the sea bed. ""There is so much debris down there and we have only lifted a few pieces. Hopefully, as we take out more [the recorders] can be found,"" he told reporters. The fact the debris does not appear to have spread far suggests the plane may have been intact before it hit the water, an investigator with Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) told news agency Reuters. ""It possibly ruptured when it hit waters because if it had exploded mid-air, the debris would be distributed more widely,"" said Nurcahyo Utomo.  Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. A turbine from one of its engines is also among the debris that has been recovered.  The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in West Kalimantan province in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. The plane is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018.

That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service.

Uganda elections 2021: Facebook shuts government-linked accounts," Facebook has shut down accounts it says are linked to the Ugandan government, only days before elections for a new president and parliament.  The social media giant said a network connected with the ministry of information had been using fake and duplicate accounts to impersonate users and boost the popularity of posts.   In a BBC interview, the government accused Facebook of being biased. The run-up to the election has been marred by tension and violence.  After 35 years in power, President Yoweri Museveni, 76, is being strongly challenged by music star Bobi Wine, who is 38 and draws much of his support from young people.  Bobi Wine has been detained periodically, and dozens of opposition protesters have been killed. Africa Live: More on this and other storiesThe 'ghetto president' aiming for the real thingWhy 35 years in power isn't enough for this manNo, Joe Biden is not backing Uganda's opposition Campaigning has been banned in the capital, Kampala, and several other districts. The opposition says this is because it is popular in those areas, but the government says the measure is due to Covid-19 restrictions.  ""We found this network to be linked to the government Citizens Interaction Center at the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology in Uganda,"" Facebook said in a statement.  ""They used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were,"" the statement continued.  But government spokesman Ofwono Opondo hit back in a BBC Facebook Live interview, accusing Facebook of failing to adhere to ""natural justice"" and echoing suggestions by other government figures that the social network is trying to influence the election outcome.  ""We are not familiar with anybody who complains about these accounts,"" he said. ""The owners have not received any notice and no-one was asked to make any response to the allegations."" Mr Opondo described Facebook as high-handed. ""I think they are playing the usual games,"" he added. ""We know that they have a side in this election perhaps.""  The government spokesman said Thursday's elections would be free and fair. The BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that the campaign period has been dominated by social media, as political parties moved to reach a young, politically aware population. Many new accounts promoting messages from both the ruling party and the opposition have popped up in the last couple of months, especially on Facebook and Twitter. In many cases, the users did not use proper names, and shared content filled with hate messages and fake news, she says.  Ugandans online have said saying that the government has finally got a taste of what it feels like to be censured. In December, the Uganda Communications Commission, the media industry regulator, wrote to Google, asking it to shut down several YouTube channels associated with Bobi Wine. In the past, the government body has ordered online content creators such as influencers and bloggers to register and have their material vetted before publication, but this was put on hold after it was challenged in court.  During the 2016 election, the government blocked social media on polling day and for several after, which led to the proliferation of VPN use in the country. It feels like there is a fresh wind blowing through social media in terms of how it deals with political content. First we saw US President Donald Trump banned from Twitter and Facebook and now that has been extended beyond the US to Africa.  Facebook has shut a slew of accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials, accusing them of ""co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"" in the public debate ahead of Thursday's election. Mark Zuckerberg has long insisted that the platform he founded has to allow all forms of free speech and cannot become an arbiter of political conversations. So what has changed? The truth is that the platform has increasingly focused on misinformation in recent years but the violence and chaos witnessed at the heart of the US government in recent days have forced it to speed up these attempts, and make some pretty big decisions. The days of describing itself as a mere conduit for content seem to be well and truly over. It has tried lots of ways to reduce misinformation, including ranking reliable journalism higher than fake news and training algorithms to identify ""bad"" posts, but it has had mixed results. But now with all eyes on it, it is going to have to find a way to deal with content in a way that pleases politicians, its users and its advertisers, who do not want to be associated with a platform that is being accused of inciting unrest or influencing the results of elections. It remains unclear how it will do so in the long term but in the short term expect more knee-jerk reactions to political events around the world. And the new look for the social network will come at a price. Some Ugandan officials are already accusing it of meddling in its election. Facebook could be stuck between a rock and a hard place for some time to come.",BBC News - World,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 17:11:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55623722
Yemen war: US to designate Houthi rebels as terrorist organisation," The US plans to designate Yemen's rebel Houthi movement as a terrorist group, despite warnings that it may threaten aid operations in the war-torn country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks threatening civilians, infrastructure and shipping. It would also deter ""malign activity"" by their backer Iran, he added. Aid organisations have said they may be prevented from operating in areas where millions are on the brink of famine.  A UN spokesman said it was clear the US decision was ""likely to have serious humanitarian and political repercussions"", while the president of the International Rescue Committee called it ""pure diplomatic vandalism"". A Houthi leader accused President Donald Trump's administration of terrorism and said the movement reserved the right to respond to any designation. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule. The coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France, while Iran has denied allegations that it has supplied the Houthis with missiles, drones, and training. The fighting has reportedly left more than 110,000 people dead and triggered what the United Nations (UN) says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection. Five reasons why coronavirus is so bad in YemenWhy is there a war in Yemen? Mr Pompeo announced late on Sunday that the state department would notify Congress of his intention to designate the Houthi movement - known formally as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God) - as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump leave's office.  Three Houthi leaders - Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abdul Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim - will also be listed as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. ""The designations are intended to hold Ansar Allah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""The designations are also intended to advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united Yemen that is both free from Iranian interference and at peace with its neighbours."" The secretary of state cited what he called ""the callous attack"" targeting the airport in the southern city of Aden on 30 December, in which 27 people were killed. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government tied the attack on the Houthis, but they denied any involvement. ""America is the source of terrorism, the Trump administration's policy is terrorist, and its actions are terrorist. It does not matter to the Yemeni people, as it is complicit in killing and starving them,"" Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi tweeted in response on Monday. He added that the rebels ""reserve the right to respond to any designation issued by the Trump administration or any administration"". Yemen's foreign ministry said it supported the move and called for further ""political and legal pressure"" on the Houthis, Reuters news agency reported. This designation has been expected for months, so advocates and opponents have been gearing up for it for some time. There has been discussion, too, over whether it should target the Houthis as a group or individuals. A Saudi source recently admitted it would be difficult to determine who was a Houthi.  But US allies in the Gulf are backers of a step meant to send a strong signal to Iran. Some argue it could provide a valuable bargaining chip for the incoming Biden administration to secure concessions. But Western diplomats involved in protracted efforts to start a political process to end this destructive war are convinced this will make it even harder. The biggest concern is humanitarian. The US says it will ensure life-saving supplies still reach Yemen. Time and again, when sanctions are imposed, it is the most innocent who suffer most. In Yemen, the impact could be catastrophic if the right measures are not put in place.   Mr Pompeo said the US recognised the concerns of humanitarian organisations and would work to reduce the impact on what he called ""certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen"". ""We are working to ensure that essential lifelines and engagements that support a political track and return to dialogue continue to the maximum extent possible."" UN spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric told reporters it was imperative that the US ""swiftly grant the necessary licenses and exemptions to ensure that principled humanitarian assistance can continue to reach all people... without disruption"". UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned in November against a unilateral US designation, saying Yemen was in ""imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades"". Five million people are living ""just one step away from famine"" in Yemen, and approximately 50,000 are living in ""famine-like conditions"", according to the UN.  The president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, warned that the designation would make the task of its teams on the ground in Yemen ""all but impossible"". ""Our concerns are not theoretical or hyperbolic, recent history - especially in Somalia - has shown us that cost of terrorism designations in the middle of complex conflicts and humanitarian crises can be measured in innocent lives lost,"" he said.

The organisation's secretary general, Jan Egeland, tweeted that US ""exemptions for aid work and civilian supplies must be crystal-clear"".

Uganda elections 2021: What you need to know," On Thursday Ugandans will vote in a general election after a campaign marked by violence which has killed dozens of people.  President Yoweri Museveni is seeking his sixth elected term in office after 35 years in power. The 76-year-old faces 10 challengers, most notably the pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine.  Human rights groups have accused security forces of using excessive force to break up opposition rallies during the campaign. But the government says the strong measures are necessary to ensure people comply with a ban on large crowds imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the five things you need to know about the crucial vote: President Museveni is one of the longest-serving presidents in Africa. He and his National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986 at the end of a five-year war, and have led Uganda ever since. His supporters praise him for bringing relative peace and prosperity to the country, and in particular for his policies on health. He helped limit the spread of HIV, and more recently his harsh lockdown - which closed schools and business, banned vehicle movement and imposed mandatory public mask use in May - is credited with tackling the coronavirus pandemic.  According to Johns Hopkins University, Uganda has recorded fewer than 40,000 infections and around just 300 deaths from the illness. But while he was once hailed in the West as one of the new generation of African leaders, his critics accuse him of turning into another authoritarian leader.  Mr Museveni has no designated successor within his party, and in 2017 signed a law removing a presidential age limit of 75, allowing him to run again for the presidency.  He has seen off a number of challengers to his rule over the years, notably long-time opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was arrested numerous times and decided not to run again for the presidency in 2021.  While Mr Museveni maintains a large support base, especially in rural areas, he is facing increasing opposition over rising inequality and his rigid control over the country. Why 35 years in power isn't enough for this man One of 10 candidates challenging him for the presidency this year is musician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known by the stage name Bobi Wine.  Affectionately referred to as the ""ghetto president"", the 38-year-old became an East African musical superstar in the early 2000s before switching to politics and winning a seat in parliament in 2017. Bobi Wine is seen as the biggest challenge to Mr Museveni's rule and has mobilised many young people who have not previously been involved in politics. He has sharply criticised the president in the past and accused him of ""fearing the people"". The president has not taken this challenge lightly. He has accused Bobi Wine of being a foreign agent of those ""who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda"" and said that opposition figures are misleading young people to get involved in violence on the campaign trail.  Bobi Wine has been arrested several times since he became involved in politics. He has spoken of a ""revolution"" against Mr Museveni. He has posted on Twitter using the hashtag ""WeAreRemovingADictator"". The 'ghetto president' aiming for the real thing Part of Bobi Wine's popularity comes down to his age. At 38, he is just half as old as President Museveni, in one of the youngest nations on earth.  According to the CIA World Factbook Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide, of just 15.7 - only Niger is younger.  The ""ghetto president"" grew up in a slum in the capital, Kampala. His background and his efforts to promote social justice in his country through his music and as a politician have endeared him to this younger, more urban generation.  But Bobi Wine has also surprised authorities by drawing big crowds of supporters in rural areas - thought to be a bastion of support for President Museveni. Tensions are high, and the campaign has been marred by serious violence, which has left dozens killed and hundreds more arrested.  Officials have cited measures brought in to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic for their efforts to break up political gatherings. But Human Rights Watch has alleged that security forces are using these regulations ""as a pretext to violate rights and clamp down on the opposition and the media"".  Bobi Wine himself was arrested last November for allegedly breaching Covid measures. His detention sparked protest which led to a wave of arrests and left dozens dead, mostly allegedly shot by the security forces. Afterwards, Security Minister Elly Tumwine pointed to the fact that 11 security personnel had been injured and said ""police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence"". ""Can I repeat? Police have a right to shoot you and you die for nothing.... do it at your own risk."" Bobi Wine has since taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest and helmet on the campaign trail.  At the end of last year he halted his campaign after a number of his team were injured as security forces dispersed one of his political rallies. He later told broadcaster CNN he had survived several assassination attempts.  A quick guide to Uganda A country of more than 42 million people, Uganda is surrounded by Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  It has one of the highest refugee populations worldwide, hosting some 1.4 million people from neighbouring countries.  Some are watching the political unrest in the country with concern, and worry about what could happen after the vote. There has never been a peaceful transfer of power in Uganda and it is not clear what would happen if Mr Museveni were to lose, and what the military would do. The president announced a shake-up of the armed forces in November, bringing in the former head of Uganda's operations in Somalia, Maj Gen Paul Lokech, as deputy inspector general of police to coordinate security forces around the capital during the election period.  The European Union has chosen not to send observers to the election this year - reportedly because Ugandan officials have ignored advice from past observers to make polling more fair - meaning there will be less international scrutiny.  No, Joe Biden is not backing Uganda's opposition",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:15:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55573581
Brexit leaves Spain's Costa Brits facing dilemmas," The new year has brought storms to Spain's Costa del Sol - the sunshine coast is being lashed by rain and wind.  It's not what thousands of British expats signed up for when they chose to come out here to live. Those living here, or those planning to in the future, will have to adjust to new post-Brexit rules.  Travel to Spain is more complicated now that the new EU-UK trade agreement has come into force. Since 1 January, the UK has been considered as a ""third country"" to the EU. Any newcomers will have to follow a new system. For any UK citizens arriving now, here are some of the differences. For tourists, including people who have second homes in the country but haven't taken residency, you can no longer come and go as you please. You can spend up to three months out of every six here. To be able to live in Spain now, you will need to show proof that you're earning, either through having a contract with a Spanish company, or by proving that you have at least Â£2,000 (â¬2,223; $2,705) a month coming into your account.  For a family, it will be much more. You will need to show that you have an extra Â£500 a month for each member of the family. For example, a family of four will need to prove they earn a yearly salary of at least Â£42,000. British driving licences will also need to be changed to Spanish ones. Read more about Brexit: A quick guide to what's in the Brexit dealGibraltar gets UK-Spain deal to keep open borderCan I still go to Spain? And other Brexit questionsHow many Brits abroad are there? The last few weeks have seen a frenetic period of adjustment, and change, with people leaving Spain for good, and others replacing them before the rules for residency changed. ""Our removal companies have never been busier. Every removal company across this coast has told our team they've never seen a situation like this,"" says Michel Euesden from Rochdale. She runs the Euro Weekly newspaper in Fuengirola, a paper that provides news for Brits living here. ""It's the first time in 25 years since we started the paper here that we've seen removal companies fully booked going out and coming back in.  ""They are taking the elderly and people who haven't had jobs for a while, because of the Covid situation, back to the UK, and then they're bringing back younger generations with disposable income, and often with an online marketing presence, out here. So the dynamics have completely changed."" Lifelong friends Jan Miller and Sonia Martin were among those who made a late dash from the UK to register as residents in Spain before the new rules kicked in. It was a three-day Christmas campervan odyssey from Warrington to Malaga for them. They're now living together in a small cottage in the mountains, along with their partners, three dogs and three cats. ""We'd talked about it for years and years,"" Jan tells me. ""We were fed up of the same old, same old routine. The same journey to work, same things at work, we wanted something different. And the Brexit rule changes made us go in the end. ""I think it's going to be much harder now from what I've heardâ¦ you've got to have more in the bank income-wise, going forward."" Meanwhile, Eric Anderson is stuck in the UK. The 71-year-old former shipyard worker from Newcastle is one of thousands of so called ""swallows"" - people with second homes in Spain who spend winter in the sun and return to Britain in the summer. Spanish Covid rules preventing non-essential travel mean that Eric can't fly out at the moment. When he can, his time will be limited under the new post-Brexit system. ""I feel badly let down. We paid a mortgage for 20 years to have a holiday home and a retirement bolt-hole for the winter. We're limited to just 90 days now, and that's not just for Spain, but anywhere we go in Europe on holiday. Say we cross from Newcastle to the Netherlands, that's counted.  ""So you're already being restricted by time to come back into the UK. There's a lot of average working guys that have done exactly what I've done and it's just not going to be possible now. I don't think anyone expected the rug to be pulled from under them so quickly."" Tracy Turnero Sheehan has made her home in the hillside town of Marchena, famous for Flamenco music and olive growing.  She left Hereford 16 years ago, and is now a Spanish resident, running an English language school by Marchena's town square. She tells me over a socially distanced coffee that her life has become much more complicated as a consequence of the new rules. ""My husband Enrique is Spanish, my son Santiago is Spanish and British. If we ever wanted to move back to the UK as a family, say in five years, then I could move back, I imagine Santi could get a British passport.  ""But Enrique would need to fit in with the minimum income or the points-based system. Which makes it almost impossible to live in the UK again. Honestly, I feel kind of forgotten about."" There is help for those considered more vulnerable who are seeking residency.  Three charities - Age in Spain, Babelia and the International Organisation for Migration - are offering legal help, or assistance in arranging appointments, for people struggling with the Spanish language, those in remote areas, and people with disabilities.  In total, there are now more than 360,000 British residents registered in Spain, according to official Spanish figures. Back in the offices of Euro Weekly, Michel Euesden predicts there will be a dramatic change to the population dynamic. ""We have traditionally been a community here of expats who are on average 50-plus. Last year it changed, and the average age was 45. If you come over in 12 months, it'll be more like an average age of 35.  ""If you're 70 or 80 years old and you don't understand this new system, the new paperwork, the driving licences needing to be switched over, say for example they get ill - what are they going to do? I think a lot of people will go back to the country where they speak the language. You no longer have the best of both worlds, and people can't rely on speaking only English to get by. ""They will be replaced by a younger set of people who can afford to be here."" The stormy weather has finally passed. So too the era of easy travel to Spain. Estate agents tell me that British people used to be the biggest buyers of property on this coast. Not any more.  The Brexit effect has already begun to change the population here, and reshape the future plans of many Brits who want to live abroad.",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:18:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55617849
Silencing Trump: How 'big tech' is taking Trumpism offline," If you ever needed proof of the power of ""Big Tech"" then the downfall of Parler on Monday morning is a good place to start. I, like many others, logged on to the controversial social network to see what would happen after 11:59 Pacific Time in the US. This was the deadline Amazon had given the app to find a new host service before it booted the platform offline for allegedly containing violent content. It was being seen as a significant moment in ongoing efforts by US tech giants to ""deplatform"" Donald Trump and some of his extreme supporters after the US Capitol Hill riot last week. Trumpâs Twitter downfall The clock struck 12:00 though and nothing happened. I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual. But then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read.  With a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now. Parler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too. Technology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons. ""Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,"" she said. It's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too. Again, this is not unheard of.  Gab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days. And as part a crackdown on accounts associated with the attack on Congress, on Monday Twitter announced it has shut down ""more than 70,000 accounts"" linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory.  What is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president. Since Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch. YouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance. European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as ""problematic"". EU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as ""the 9/11 moment of social media"", writing in Politico that ""the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing"". UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now ""taking editorial decisions"", adding that platforms were ""choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice"". Elsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship. He tweeted: ""The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship."" The fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter. One of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse. Platforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders. In March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation. It wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence. The president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts"". Social media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets ""a pivotal precedent"" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post. Some analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide. On Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election. Privacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants.  ""Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally."" In his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for ""banning"" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post. Many argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do. US President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news. In the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with ""various other sites"" and that there would be ""a big announcement soon"". If the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media.",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 03:23:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55624630
Danke Apartment: The 'broken eggshell' that left young Chinese homeless," On a cold winter's evening recently, Beijing resident Xiaoyue and his wife returned to their rented flat after dinner - only to find another couple standing at their door, changing the locks. The man and woman were their landlords. They wanted Xiaoyue and his wife out of their apartment immediately, because they hadn't paid their rent for months. Xiaoyue was stunned. ""I was completely unprepared for this,"" he told the BBC in a recent interview. The 28-year-old said he had been paying his rent in huge lump sums, sometimes for six months at a go.  So where had his money gone? Xiaoyue would soon find out that he and his landlords were among the many victims of a housing controversy that has exposed the vulnerability of China's young urban workers and become a cautionary tale of the country's exuberant tech start-up scene. It has reportedly left many young Chinese - potentially thousands - homeless. Some say they have been forced out onto the streets in the middle of a freezing winter, and one even reportedly killed himself. Many homeowners also say they are owed massive amounts of unpaid rent. At the heart of the controversy is Chinese housing app Danke Apartment, once considered one of the country's most promising start-ups. When it first launched in 2015, it was an instant hit with China's fresh graduates and young professionals moving to big cities, offering them affordable housing in places such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou where property prices can be sky-high.  The business model for Danke, which means ""eggshell"" in Chinese, is simple - it rents flats from landlords long-term, renovates them, then sublets the flats or individual rooms as single units to tenants at a relatively affordable rate. It has sometimes been described as WeWork for residential property. In recent months Danke appears to have run into trouble, though it has rejected claims that it is bankrupt. As the rental market cooled during the coronavirus pandemic, the increasingly beleaguered Beijing-based broker allegedly stopped paying landlords rent money which the company had collected from tenants for months. This has prompted homeowners to evict tenants.  But tenants are also refusing to leave, maintaining they have a right to stay as they have already forked out rent. Many have paid an entire year's worth of rent already, as the option offered by Danke promised discounted rates. ""The landlord wanted to cancel his contract with Danke, chase me away, and rent the place to someone else. But my own contract with Danke was still in effect,"" said Xiaoyue. The young bank worker considers himself luckier than most, as he has managed to keep a roof over his head.  The country building a 'new London' every yearFormaldehyde fears in China's property boomCoronavirus may have huge impact on property markets In the end, both Xiaoyue and his landlord terminated their respective Danke agreements and signed a fresh contract with each other through another property agent, even though they may each end up forfeiting at least a month's rent of 3,000 yuan ($465, Â£342).  ""I'm just a young worker. I don't have the ability nor the energy to file a lawsuit to try to get the money back,"" said Xiaoyue. Others haven't been as fortunate.  Since November, there have been numerous reports on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo documenting the various ways Danke tenants have been forced out of their homes by their landlords. One user described how her landlord had stormed into her room and started throwing out her personal belongings. Some said that they had their electricity and water supplies cut abruptly; others said they faced gangster-like intimidation tactics.  Recent trending posts on Weibo claimed that tenants had to sleep in fast food outlets to seek refuge from the cold while they tried to find alternative housing. Many have posted complaints using terms and hashtags like ""broken eggshell"" and ""has Danke refunded me my money yet"". In a widely reported news story last month, a 20-year-old man in the southern city of Guangzhou set fire to his flat before jumping to his death. Local media reports, which identified the man as Zhong Chunyuan, linked his death to the fact that he was a Danke tenant.  In a Pear Video interview, Mr Zhong's mother said her son had told her he was facing eviction from his landlord as the broker had ""run away with the money"". Mr Zhong's brother said that no matter the reason for his death, ""Danke shoulders a big responsibility"" and the family were considering suing the company. Authorities have yet to confirm whether Mr Zhong's death was due to his housing predicament. But that has not stopped his story from going viral. On Weibo, a hashtag related to his death has been viewed more than 250 million times and has generated over 42,000 related posts.  Danke has rejected claims it has run out of money, although it has yet to publicly address allegations that it has withheld rent money. ""We are not bankrupt and we won't run away! Don't believe the rumours!"" read one statement posted on its Weibo account in November, which has since gone silent in recent weeks. The BBC has emailed Danke for comment. Analysts say the Danke crisis has exposed the vulnerability of the hundreds of thousands of young Chinese moving to big cities every year for better job prospects. Clemson University's associate professor of economics Kevin Tsui told the BBC: ""Labour mobility among young people in China is common, but the property market in big cities is not affordable for many of them. That's why there's a significant demand for units with affordable rent."" To encourage tenants to sign up, Danke promised discounted rates if tenants paid a year's worth of rent upfront by taking out loans from a partner bank. More than 160,000 tenants have taken loans from online-only lender WeBank, for example, which is backed by tech giant Tencent. Experts say the company expanded its debt-fuelled model too aggressively and too fast. In just five years, the firm had a presence in 13 cities, and the number of apartments it managed jumped from 2,400 to more than 415,000 as of March last year. In January 2020, it listed on the New York Stock Exchange, raising US$149 million. But things began to fall apart when the coronavirus hit and cities went into lockdown, as there were just not enough new renters joining the programme to help maintain the company's capital flow.  ""The company has certainly failed from a financial point of view, but its impact is even worse from a social point of view. Regular folks do not understand how its business model works, so the firm managed to take advantage of a lot of young people,"" says Ms Edith Yeung, a general partner at venture capital firm Race Capital. Dr Tsui added: ""These young people are so used to e-commerce, but at the same time have little experience in the financial world. That's why they are the most vulnerable group for a situation like this."" Last month, WeBank pledged that it would waive interest payments and extend loan terms for its customers till the end of 2023. Chinese authorities are also now investigating Danke for its cashflow problems, and have placed its parent company on the government's ""social credit"" blacklist. But that is cold comfort for the many Danke customers left hanging. Tenants in recent weeks say they have had trouble logging into the company's smartphone app containing their information and telephone calls to the company hotline have gone unanswered.  Since Christmas Day, all listings for available properties have been removed from the online platform, leaving many uncertain whether Danke is still operating as a company. Meanwhile, Danke's customers are still relentlessly posting their calls for justice and help on Weibo. Said one user: ""Even though it's a new year and we should say goodbye to the old and welcome the new, we cannot bid farewell to this issue.""

Hindu shrine desecration: Can Pakistan protect its religious minorities?," A century-old sacred Hindu shrine in Pakistan was destroyed by a Muslim mob in December - the second ransacking and desecration of the holy site. Pakistan's Supreme Court has issued an order to officials in the north-western district of Karak to pave the way for rebuilding the Sri Param Hansji Maharaj Samadhi temple, but the attack has left the country's Hindus feeling vulnerable and the government facing accusations that it is failing to protect the country's religious minorities.  Pakistan is overwhelmingly Muslim - the Hindu community makes up less than 2% of the population. Prejudice against Hindus is ingrained.  The Hindus who attend the Sri Param Hansji Maharaj Samadhi were still in the process of rebuilding the site after the first attack, in 1997, after the Supreme Court finally issued a rebuilding order in 2015. But in the process, the community bought and began renovating an adjacent house to provide a resting place for Hindu pilgrims - setting off a wave of anger among local Muslims convinced that the temple was being expanded. In December, a rally was convened that was quickly whipped into a destructive mob. The rally was convened on 30 December near the temple, and led by a local Muslim cleric, Maulvi Mohammad Sharif, who is affiliated with the religious party Jamiate Ulemae Islam and was the same cleric who led the attack on the temple in 1997. According to witnesses, the cleric whipped up the crowd, inciting rally goers who then smashed in the walls of the temple with sledgehammers and set fire to it.  A report compiled by Pakistan's Commission for Minority Rights after the attack found that precious ornaments were destroyed, as were ornate wooden doors and windows made from Burma teak and the carved white marble of the grave of a Hindu saint. ""The overall picture ... was of utter devastation,"" the report said. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Police and security guards had been stationed at the temple during the rally but failed to stop the mob. ""They went with impunity,"" said the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Gulzar Ahmed, after the attack, adding that the incident had caused ""international embarrassment to Pakistan"". Police arrested 109 people in relation to the attack, including Maulvi Mohammad Sharif, and suspended 92 police officials, including the superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police who were on duty at the time. ""There were 92 police officials at the spot, but they showed cowardice and negligence,"" admitted Sanaullah Abbasi, the local police inspector general. There were no Hindus at the temple at the time - they travel to the site for religious purposes but none live at the site - and no-one was injured or killed. Located in Teri village on a desert patch featuring dry hills, the temple was built in 1919, long before the British partition of India pushed many Hindus south to India and many Muslims north into newly-created Pakistan. The site was the last resting place of Sri Param Hansji Maharaj, a Hindu saint who has a large following in Pakistan, India and elsewhere in the world.  Waseem Khatak, a researcher, teacher and journalist from the village, said the area had a large Hindu population which was mainly involved in trade, business and money-lending, and Hindus and Muslims lived side by side in a collective culture. Sri Param Hansji Maharaj ""knew the Quran by heart"", Mr Khatak said, ""and would offer spiritual guidance to his Muslim followers by quoting from the book"". Hindus made pilgrimages to the site from all over, but when the British instigated partition in 1947 the entire Hindu population of Teri village left, abandoning their properties. The government set up a trust to take over and manage the properties they had left behind and occasional pilgrimages continued. The property of the shrine was left in the care of a disciple of the saint, who converted to Islam and became the caretaker. But after the caretaker's death in the 1960s, his sons sold the place to two local Muslim families. Access to the tomb became an arduous task - pilgrims had to pass through the privacy of two family homes to perform their rituals. In the mid-1990s, the community bought one of the houses for easy access to the tomb. But the purchase happened at a time when local Muslim clerics enjoyed considerable influence with the Pakistani establishment. In 1996, soon after the news about the house deal was broken to the clergy, Maulvi Mohammad Sharif declared the Hindu community ""agents of the US and India"" and led a mob to destroy the temple. The destruction sparked a series of court cases that continued until 2015, when the Supreme Court finally ordered the restoration of the shrine, though on a much smaller piece of land inside one of the two houses. Even then, the local government continued to delay funds for reconstruction. Frustrated, the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) rebuilt the shrine and widened and paved the street leading to it, paying from its own coffers. What happens next? As well as ordering the reconstruction of the temple, the Supreme Court has asked the local authorities to take tougher action against the police officials who were on duty during the attack.  One of the suspended policemen - who requested anonymity - told the BBC that the local police had intelligence reports before the attack that trouble was likely, but no-one thought it was worthwhile to counter the clergy. ""Given the developments in the region, the clerics are still relevant to our state policy,"" he said. ""If we cross their path, we may risk our jobs. So unless there are very clear instructions from above, we don't do that. And this allows the more ambitious among them to take advantage."" Members of the Hindu community say that restoration of a temple alone will not restore harmony. That would begin with changes to the education curriculum, which they say promotes apathy, even callousness towards non-Muslims. ""It is the failure of the system that a purely local dispute which could easily have been resolved in the light of the law and the constitution spiralled into a national and then an international issue,"" said Haroon Sarab Diyal, a Hindu community leader based in Peshawar. Just a week before the attack on the temple in December, a meeting of Pakistan's Commission for Minority Rights concluded that a ""visible improvement in the treatment of minorities"" was needed in Pakistan. In a report issued after the attack, the commission concluded that there was still a way to go.",BBC News - World,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:32:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55545524

At times the internet has been cut off entirely. It makes making and uploading content extremely difficult, as Reha Kansara reports for BBC Trending and BBC Minute. The Indian government says the measures are necessary to clamp down on militants â but rights organisations call them a serious breach of civil liberties.

Covid-19: Rule-breakers 'increasingly likely' to be fined - Cressida Dick," It is ""preposterous"" that anyone could be unaware of the need to follow the coronavirus lockdown rules, the UK's most senior police officer has said. Dame Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said Covid rule-breakers were now ""increasingly likely"" to be fined by officers. Writing in the Times, she said people were still holding house parties, raves and gambling gatherings in basements. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said tighter measures cannot be ruled out. But speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Mr Hancock pleaded for people to follow the current rules, saying: ""It is your actions now that can make a difference."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was currently no expectation that a more extensive clampdown of rules was on its way from Westminster. The Scottish government's cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss restrictions. How could lockdown rules be tougher?What are the lockdown rules across the UK?PM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home Latest figures on Monday showed a further 529 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, while another 46,169 cases were reported.  There are also more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, data shows. In her warning in the Times, Dame Cressida said officers were still finding people breaking the rules, despite clear laws that ban social gatherings. ""Most people are doing the right thing to keep each other safe, but sadly a small minority of people continue to flagrantly ignore the rules, for example by holding house parties, meeting in basements to gamble or breaking into railway arches for unlicensed raves,"" she said. ""It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus.  ""We have been clear that those who breach Covid-19 legislation are increasingly likely to face fines."" Dame Cressida said officers would now be moving ""much more quickly to enforcement action"".  Could I be fined for breaking lockdown rules? Police chiefs have been under increasing pressure to enforce the lockdown laws - with a number of news reports about breaches of Covid rules in recent days. In England and Wales, police have issued 8,000 penalties since November.  Officers have been stopping people and asking them where they have travelled from, while elsewhere people have been discovered using pubs and gyms. In one case, two women were fined Â£200 each by Derbyshire Police when they drove five miles for a walk together - but the force has since withdrawn the penalties. After that incident gained widespread media attention, the National Police Chiefs' Council issued fresh guidance to officers. Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended the way police have handled breaches, saying there is a need for ""strong enforcement"". But behavioural scientist Professor Stephen Reicher said evidence suggested 80-90% of people were by and large obeying the rules - except when it came to self-isolation where compliance was lower. ""The problem isn't people breaking the rules,"" said Mr Reicher, who sits on a committee of behavioural scientists that advises the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. ""In many cases it's either the rules aren't clear enough, or the rules are too soft, or else people don't have the support to do what they're asked to do."" Speaking on BBC Newsnight's programme, he said one reason the virus was still spreading was because many people were still going to work. ""We are defining all sorts of jobs as essential that aren't,"" he said. Conservative former health minister Steve Brine led calls for an end to non-essential takeaway sales, including coffee. ""Stop the coffee,"" he told Newsnight. ""There are so many things that we are doing, which are allowed in the rules... but I just don't think they are wise right now.""

Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which are in charge of making their own coronavirus restrictions. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200 - but are lower in Scotland.  Large parties can be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. Speaking at Downing Street, Mr Hancock warned that the UK was at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, adding: ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference. ""Stay at home, and please reduce all social contact that is not absolutely strictly necessary. That's what is needed: act like you have the virus."" The government also published its plan to vaccinate tens of millions of people by the spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot.  Police chief constables have been lobbying ministers to prioritise frontline officers to get vaccinated, as the rate of officers self-isolating has risen.

"Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, says BRC trade body"," Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show. While food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995. Christmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed. ""Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. ""Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,"" she said. The 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better''Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' In December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures. Online non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online. The BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: ""In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure. ""Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made."" But he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally. Last week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said.",BBC News - UK,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55625246
Covid-19: UAE dropped from UK travel corridor list," The United Arab Emirates is being removed from the UK list of travel corridors amid a spike in Covid cases.

UK officials say Covid cases have risen 52% in the UAE in the last seven days and cite ""a significant acceleration in the number of imported cases"". It comes after Scotland removed the UAE city Dubai from its safe travel list. The Foreign Office has also updated its advice to advise against all but essential travel to the emirates. The recent lockdown restrictions imposed across the UK mean leisure travel is currently banned.

Covid: Eyesight risk warning from lockdown screen time," An eye health charity is recommending people learn the ""20-20-20"" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens.  Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen. Out of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested. Opticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said.  The representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus.  Respondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision. The research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people ""the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions"". Fight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: ""More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions.""  But even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested. Government guidance states that under lockdown people can leave home for medical appointments and to ""avoid injury, illness or risk of harm"".  The College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems.  Optometrists are the professionals most likely to carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice.  Routine appointments can also be provided ""if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests"", the guidance states.  Screen break advice for children in lockdownNine ways lockdown is different from last time Clinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown.  ""Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,"" he said.  ""The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online."" UK health and safety legislation states employers must pay for eye tests for their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day.  In the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least 10,000 people had missed out on essential eye care in Britain.  In the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic. A Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: ""It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.""",BBC News - UK,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:38:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55620100
Brexit: UK driver has ham sandwiches confiscated at Dutch border," A Dutch TV network has filmed border officials confiscating ham sandwiches and other foods from drivers arriving in the Netherlands from the UK, under post-Brexit rules. The officials were shown explaining import regulations imposed since the UK formalised its separation from the EU. Under EU rules, travellers from outside the bloc are banned from bringing in meat and dairy products. The rules appeared to bemuse one driver. ""Since Brexit, you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff,"" a Dutch border official told the driver in footage broadcast by TV network NPO 1. In one scene, a border official asked the driver whether several of his tin-foil wrapped sandwiches had meat in them.  When the driver said they did, the border official said: ""Okay, so we take them all."" Surprised, the driver then asked the officials if he could keep the bread, to which one replied: ""No, everything will be confiscated - welcome to the Brexit, sir. I'm sorry."" The UK officially finished its formal separation from the EU on 31 December, 2020. From 23:00 GMT on that date, the UK stopped following EU rules, with new arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation coming into force. A trade deal with the EU was agreed on 24 December, and a week later, UK lawmakers voted in favour of the agreement. The UK's departure means big changes for business - with the UK and EU forming two separate markets - the end of free movement, and new regulations, including those governing the import of personal goods. Boris Johnson hails free trade deal with EUWhat are the key points of the Brexit deal?Are the borders ready? The UK government has issued guidance to commercial drivers travelling to the EU, warning them to ""be aware of additional restrictions to personal imports"". ""You cannot bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (e.g. a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU,"" the guidance says. ""There are exceptions to this rule for certain quantities of powdered infant milk, infant food, special foods, or special processed pet feed."" On its website, the European Commission says the ban is necessary because such goods ""continue to present a real threat to animal health throughout the Union"". ""It is known, for example, that dangerous pathogens that cause animal diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease and classical swine fever can reside in meat, milk or their products,"" the Commission says. Separately, the Dutch customs agency shared a picture of foodstuffs it had confiscated from motorists in the ferry terminal the Hook of Holland.  ""Since 1 January, you can't just bring more food from the UK,"" the agency said. ""So prepare yourself if you travel to the Netherlands from the UK and spread the word. This is how we prevent food waste and together ensure that the controls are speeded up."" The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam described the confiscation of ham sandwiches and other foodstuffs at the EU's borders with the UK as ""a standard implication of [the] Brexit deal"".

Covid: Around half of intensive care patients in Wales are dying," Around half of patients admitted to Welsh intensive care units during the second wave of the pandemic have died, a study has found. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) found men aged in their 60s were more likely to need intensive care. It also found those from Asian backgrounds and deprived areas were disproportionately affected. But a leading doctor said, overall, people were more likely to survive now. Intensive care consultant Matt Morgan said new treatments meant only the sickest patients were reaching intensive care, where outcomes were poorer. ICNARC collected information on 431 Welsh patients who were critically ill with coronavirus from 1 September to 31 December 2020 as part of a UK-wide audit of intensive care patients. Of the patients who were admitted, 68% were men and 32% women. The average age of a patient was 59.5 years. While the vast majority of patients were white (91.6%), the number of patients of Asian ethnicity was more than double the proportion of the Asian population, with 6.3% of patients recorded as being Asian, compared to an average of 2.4% in their local population. The audit of patients found that, excluding those still being treated at the unit, half had died while half had been discharged.  Although the numbers of patients surveyed is relatively low for statistical purposes, Dr Morgan said the survival rate reflected the situation in hospitals. Covid patients 'could reach double April peak'New variant blamed for Wrexham Covid spike Hospital stretched as Covid cases rise rapidly ""We are putting fewer people, who are in the first stage of their illness, on to life support machines. And that is because we have treatments now that we know can help,"" he said. ""Overall, you are more likely now to survive Covid than ever before, and that is in every age group - sometimes by as much as 10% more. ""What we do know is that overall, out of every ten people who come to intensive care with Covid about six of them will survive and will leave the intensive care unit. Which means sadly four them won't, four of them will die. ""That's similar overall to the first wave but that data is based on some patients who are still in the intensive care unit. So that may change and it's more likely to get worse rather than better."" ""We also know patients who are on life support machines in the intensive care unit will do worse than those who come to the intensive care unit and are not on life support machines.  ""For those people, it's probably five out of 10 people who will survive and five who will sadly die and that may be worse when we have the data on those who are still there. ""And there's a big effect of age. So for those over the age of 70 it may be as little as four people out of 10 who survive, maybe less. And for those over the age of 80 it may be as low as one or two people out of ten who survive.  SYMPTOMS: What are they and how to guard against them?LOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?GLOBAL SPREAD: How many worldwide cases are there? The figures from ICNARC also highlight how people from poorer backgrounds were more likely to need treatment in intensive care. Using a deprivation score from 1 to 5, more than half of patients scored 4 or 5, representing the most deprived postcodes in Wales. Dr Morgan said: ""Sadly, disease is an illness of deprivation. ""And so that's why we feel it, particularly in Wales where the industrial scars of our past are still very much there - and our health is there.""",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 23:00:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55622366
Ocean pollutants 'have negative effect on male fertility'," Long-lived banned industrial chemicals may be threatening the fertility of male porpoises living off the UK. Polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) were phased out decades ago, but can build up in whales, dolphins and porpoises. Scientists say harbour porpoises exposed to PCBs had shrunken testicles, suggesting an effect on sperm count and fertility. They say that while these are preliminary findings, more must be done to clean up the oceans. PCBs have been linked with a number of threats to whales and dolphins, but research has focused on mothers and their young. A study led by scientists at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found high levels of PCBs were linked to smaller testicles in otherwise healthy animals. They think this could have an impact on sperm count, with obvious implications for reproductive success. ""In porpoises, reduced testes weights have been associated with lower sperm counts so we think that if PCBs are reducing testes weights they may also be reducing sperm counts but we hope to do further research to confirm this,"" said lead researcher Rosie Williams of ZSL.  Populations of harbour porpoises around the UK are believed to be stable, though the animals face threats from pollution, accidental fishing and infection. The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals. PCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment. A series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity. The chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea. PCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises. One killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded. 'Shocking' pollutant levels in UK whale Although levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely. PCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life.  A recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a ""cocktail of pollutants"", which are passed down from mother to calf. 'Toxic chemical cocktail' passed to baby porpoises 'Cocktail of pollutants' found in dolphins Scientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain. In humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality. Strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast. The deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections. In the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades. The study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility. ""Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,"" said Rosie Williams. Populations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility. ""This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,"" she said. ""That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals."" There are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber. The study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.

Covid: Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppers," Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK?Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in WalesWhat are the social distancing rules?Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks.""  Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe.  ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups.  ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers. Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK.  In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond.  ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday that he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week that it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets.  It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary. ",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:33:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55618408
Coronavirus: Boris Johnson criticised over bike ride seven miles from home," Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown.  The Evening Standard reported the prime minister had been spotted in the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday. Government advice allows people to exercise outside, but says you should not travel outside your local area. A No 10 spokesman would not confirm if Mr Johnson had been driven to the park or cycled there, but said the PM had complied with Covid-19 guidelines. Labour's Andy Slaughter said: ""Once again it is do as I say, not as I do, from the prime minister.  The Hammersmith MP added: ""London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example."" In response to the criticism, a Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The PM has exercised within the Covid rules and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong."" Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police''Concern' over Covid rule breakers in supermarketsWhat is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? A woman told the PA news agency she had seen the prime minister in the park: ""He was leisurely cycling with another guy with a beanie hat and chatting, while around four security guys, possibly more, cycled behind them. ""Considering the current situation with Covid I was shocked to see him cycling around looking so care-free.  ""Also, considering he's advising everyone to stay at home and not leave their area, shouldn't he stay in Westminster and not travel to other boroughs?"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at Monday's Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules. Mr Hancock said: ""It is OK, if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise, but stay local."" The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after two women said they were surrounded by police and fine Â£200 after driving five miles from home to take a walk.  Derbyshire Police have now dropped the fine and apologised to the women, but the incident led to a debate over the guidance.  Government advice for England says you can leave your home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" In Scotland, the advice is more precise, saying exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area"". Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, has written to the PM calling for clearer guidance on exercise similar to that in Scotland. He wrote: ""On the one hand, our local police force here in Cumbria are reporting that people... have travelled hundreds of miles to take their exercise in the Lake District. ""And on the other hand, I have constituents writing to me, worried whether they will be punished for driving five minutes up the road to go for a walk in their local park."" Mr Farron added: ""We need a solution that clearly deters people from making lengthy trips and potentially spreading the virus, but also that doesn't discourage people from keeping fit and healthy.""",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 19:31:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55620138
Covid-19: New test rule for UK arrivals from Friday," Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will be required for everyone travelling to the UK from 04:00 GMT on Friday.  People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. All those arriving from places not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. There are issues with testing availability and capacity, so some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda for six days. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently.  Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'UAE dropped from UK travel corridor listWhy is the UK bringing in travel testing? The government said all forms of PCR test would be accepted, as would other forms of test ""with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity"". The announcement comes after a further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Monday. There were also 46,169 cases reported.  More than 32,000 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Also on Monday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs the UK economy would ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic.

UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'," The UK economy will ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned. The chancellor told MPs the new national restrictions were necessary to control the spread of coronavirus.  However, he said they would have a further significant economic impact, ""Even with the significant economic support we've provided, over 800,000 people have lost their job since February,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have not and will not be able to save every job and every business. ""But I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses."" The chancellor said ""the road ahead will be tough"", but maintained that the government was ""taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country"". He said that fiscal stimulus provided so far amounted to more than Â£280bn, while 1.2 million employers had furloughed almost 10 million employees. At the same time, three million people had benefited from self-employment grants. Mr Sunak said he would ""bear in mind"" calls to extend business rate relief and provide further support for the hospitality sector at the Budget in March. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of being ""out of ideas"" and providing ""nothing new"". She said: ""The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know."" The chancellor's words reflect the fact that with a widespread lockdown, the first months of 2021 are likely to see a further contraction in the UK economy and probably an official double-dip recession. This reflects the physical shutdown nationwide of hospitality and retail, as well as the effect in the data of school shutdowns too. In addition, consumers and workers are likely to be more cautious as the vaccine starts to be rolled out. So this is a very odd sort of economic tripwire. The challenge in the next weeks and months gets bigger, although not as big as it was last April. But beyond that, there is the hope of something normal. The implication for the chancellor as he prepares a vital early March Budget, however, is further delay to the measures, such as tax rises, to deal with historic levels of pandemic government borrowing.

Covid: Couple on 60-mile lockdown trip rescued from hilltop," A couple on a 60-mile lockdown trip had to be rescued from the summit of one of Yorkshire's three peaks. The ""ill-equipped"" pair called for help after losing their way amid fog and snow on Ingleborough on Sunday afternoon. Volunteer rescuers found the man and woman, from Rochdale, ""cold and shaken"" but otherwise unharmed, North Yorkshire Police said. It said the pair's actions were ""not necessary and not acceptable"". Supt Mike Walker said officers had been ""run off their feet"" as they dealt with ""numerous out-of-area visitors"" to the area. More news from across Yorkshire The couple were ""incredibly fortunate"" to have escaped without injury, Supt Walker said, who criticised their decision to make the journey.  He said the public was ""clearly advised"" to stay at home over the weekend and to ""stay local"" when taking exercise. ""Quite simply driving miles and miles, out of your village, town or city to visit an open space is not a necessary journey and is not acceptable,"" he said. ""Neither is arriving at a challenging walking location, inexperienced and unprepared in treacherous weather conditions."" Their ""irresponsible and ill-informed decision"" could have risked the safety of rescuers and placed further pressure upon the NHS, he said. The force said officers issued more than 70 fines in the county over the weekend, including for several house parties in Scarborough.  North Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan said ""taking a day trip to North Yorkshire from elsewhere"" was not a valid reason for travel.

Covid: Life on the frontline as part of an emergency ambulance crew," Francesca works as part of London Ambulance Service's emergency ambulance crew (EAC). The role means she often drives the ambulance and goes out on call outs with a paramedic - she is also able to provide some treatment herself. She tells the BBC what it is like working on the NHS frontline at the minute, with coronavirus cases rising steeply.  I've worked throughout the pandemic. Up until now it's felt manageable and I was optimistic the NHS could cope. But with the surge in cases this week, the gravity of the situation really hit home. The NHS already feels at breaking point. For the first time I'm not sure we will be able to treat everyone who needs it. Up until December I was typically seeing perhaps one or two Covid patients per 12-hour ambulance shift - the rest could be elderly fallers, people who have had fits, people experiencing mental health crisis, that kind of thing. This started changing as the new variant emerged and infections accelerated. How busy are hospitals in England? What happens if hospitals are overwhelmed?  In the last four days pretty much all my patients have been Covid patients, give or take a couple of exceptions. What's been striking is that we'll turn up to see one person and find that literally everyone else in the family is infected, too. That wasn't happening before.  In this part of London there are many intergenerational Bangladeshi families living together, so that might be a family of eight or more all infected with the virus. It's affecting all types of communities, but some are being particularly hard hit. Often when we arrive the patients look terrified and are breathing so fast, they are gasping and simply unable to speak. Relatives tell me they wanted to call an ambulance earlier, but the patient was too scared of going to hospital.  They tell us they know too many people from their communities who went into hospital with Covid and never came back. Sometimes people are in denial that they have the disease, even with the classic symptoms of breathing difficulties, a cough, and loss of taste or smell. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's a combination of fear or shame, or perhaps it's the influence of the conspiracy theorists telling people Covid doesn't exist. For elderly frail people with comorbidities like dementia, diabetes or advanced cancer, we know their chances of recovering are slimmer. It feels wrong in so many ways taking them away from their families; they may well die in hospital and never see them again. But unless a palliative care plan has been made for the patient to stay at home, which they have agreed to whilst they still have mental capacity, we don't have much option but to take them to hospital. Sometimes we've had 10 or more family members clambering onto the ambulance to say their goodbyes. Naturally, they want to kiss or hug their loved one. Yet there is a huge infection risk.  My medical head says we need to go now; the patient is critically ill and I don't want them to decline further and go into respiratory arrest. But it feels desperately brutal telling their loved ones they must say goodbye. I have to turn off my emotions, concentrate on what needs to be done, and not look too much at the family's anguished faces as I shut the doors. This week I've treated several younger, fitter patients too, including a young white guy in his late 30s with children under five. He seemed shocked and panicked, telling me he's never ill, he runs regularly and cycles to work, but has felt simply wretched since coming down with Covid over Christmas.  As we did his checks, he became tearful telling me he feels like he's dying. In his case, his oxygen SATs (saturation level) are still within normal range, albeit on the lower end. He's not sick enough to warrant hospital and I know if we take him in it's simply putting extra strain on already-stretched resources and he'll be discharged. So we leave him home with advice on what to do if his condition worsens and reassurance that he can call us back any time. A woman we see later in the week is quietly stoical and initially seems not too poorly, or not ""big sick"" as we say in the trade. But after we check her SATs we find she has silent hypoxia, meaning her oxygen level is already dangerously low (around 70% - normal is 94-98%). It is ""silent"" because she is not experiencing the shortness of breath which might have alerted her or family sooner. She is 50, slim, leads an active life and does not fit the profile of those we might expect to become critically ill. We give her high-flow oxygen, grab a bag for her purse, phone and charger and she's being wheeled out of her home within 10 minutes. Even though her English is poor, we're unable to bring her daughter to translate because the hospitals can't cope with the extra people and the infection risk. En route, other than giving oxygen, stroking their hands and telling them we're here to look after them, there's little we can do to treat patients. The best place for them is hospital, where there are more options - including drugs like dexamethasone - and the medical teams are now experts having dealt with hundreds, if not thousands, of patients. We take patients to hospitals across east and north London. For the last couple of weeks all these hospitals have been breaching, day after day, meaning their emergency departments are effectively full and patients have to wait in ambulances or divert to the next nearest hospital.  We get messages telling us which hospitals to avoid. Sometimes it feels like dominoes with one hospital falling after another and I'm wondering if we'll be sent out of London soon. The longest wait I've had to hand over a patient at hospital is three hours, but there have been longer. Not only is this distressing for our patients on board, but it's also tying up our ambulances for hours at a time.  This obviously leads to delays in our response times. We are also seriously understaffed with so many of our own people off sick or isolating. We have the fire brigade helping us already, as well as St John Ambulance volunteers, and I hear the police will be joining us, too, soon. Even resuscitation patients, who are the sickest, have to sometimes wait on ambulances, as staff scramble to free up beds. I've never seen this happen before.  In these cases, we update the staff regularly on the patient's condition and if they show signs of deterioration, they will find them a place. Hospitals are adapting constantly, introducing new systems, repurposing wards and spaces into Covid wards, building isolation pods and bringing in staff from other areas of the hospitals to help.  With the less seriously ill patients, we are being encouraged to call ahead and discuss them with consultants who can sometimes offer alternatives to them being admitted - such as being assessed by an initial video call, having daily phone calls, and with home monitoring kits that include SATs monitors.  I'm amazed at how upbeat and professional the hospital staff are, although this week the cracks have been showing with nurses and consultants looking worn out and stressed, and occasionally snapping at us.  Mainly though we're all pulling together and despite the stresses and relentlessness of this pandemic, I'm glad I'm here helping, at the eye of the storm as it were. I feel privileged to be doing something useful during this time. Francesca's name and some patients' details have been changed or removed to protect their anonymity.

"Covid: Parents' coronavirus warning after daughter, 25, dies"," Covid-19 put a whole family in hospital over Christmas - but it was their 25-year-old daughter who didn't survive. On Christmas Day, the Jones family from Llwynypia in the Rhondda all felt so unwell, they didn't even bother opening their presents. Paul, Karen and Lauren Jones had all tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in December and it had hit them hard - with Paul and Karen spending short spells in hospital.   But not long after Christmas their ""living nightmare"" continued, when Lauren told her parents she wanted to go to the local hospital ""just to get checked out"". ""I watched her walk from the car to the hospital. I thought she would have been out later that day,"" said Paul, who works as a police officer. Mum and sons die after catching Covid-19'Miracle' Covid survivor feared his life was overLockdown causing 'acute grief' for bereaved But Lauren did not speak to her parents until the next day and by then she was receiving treatment to help her breathing.   ""I spoke to Lauren at about half three in the afternoon,""said Karen.  ""She said she'd just had a little bit of ice cream and some water and was going back on the C-PAP machine. She said not to worry. That was the last contact we ever had with her. "" Lauren was well known and loved in her local community - she worked as an administrator at a GP surgery in Tonypandy and delivered Avon and Bodyshop products in her village. She also loved animals, travelling and music. Her health, though, declined rapidly. Within 24 hours, her parents were told she wasn't expected to survive the next night. They went to be with her at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant during her last moments in the early hours of 30 December. ""We were both with her when she came into the world and we were both with her when she left the world,"" said Karen. ""The ITU staff were marvellous. The one last image I remember is, as Lauren left us, all the staff were protecting her around the bed. They were absolutely distraught as well."" Paul added: ""They said Lauren was the youngest patient they'd had in the Royal Glam. Not a statistic you want your daughter to be."" The family are now struggling to understand how she deteriorated so quickly. Lauren had suffered from a condition called complex regional pain syndrome in her foot, which meant she used crutches. She also had high blood pressure - but her parents say it was nothing that meant she would have been more at risk. They also wonder if things could have been different - Lauren and her mother Karen, who also works for the NHS, were just days away from having their Covid vaccinations when they had to start self-isolating.

"My spending has gone up, not down, in lockdown'"," There are few benefits from lockdown, but one often touted is that people are managing to save a little money: lower transport costs, fewer shop-bought office lunches, cheaper childcare costs and no foreign holidays. Single mum Caroline Rice gives a wry smile when asked if she's managed to squirrel away extra cash over the past few months during pandemic restrictions. ""My spending is up,"" she says. ""The heating costs are higher because it's very cold. I'm having to shop locally because of lockdown, where the prices are slightly higher. The nearest Asda is 12 miles away."" The small savings on little luxuries that many people are making - fewer coffees or restaurant meals - were never an option for her in the first place.  Her meagre finances meant the registered child minder, who lives in rural County Fermanagh, was already living week-to-week. Now it seems like day-to-day, she says. ""There's a mental stress, fatigue, in having to check the bank balance every day to see how much I'm down,"" she says. ""My child and I haven't bought any clothes in almost a year."" She's having to home-school her child. Many people wouldn't think twice about printing off their child's maths homework project. Caroline had to write it out by hand because they could not afford the ink. And she is not alone. A new report on the finances of low-income families during the pandemic says they are twice as likely to have increased their spending.  It says extra costs for food, energy and remote learning equipment have piled financial pressure on the poor.  The study - Pandemic Pressures - was a collaboration between the Resolution Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities research project at the University of York. Dr Ruth Patrick, a social policy lecturer at the University of York, says talk of saving money during the pandemic is ""worlds away"" from the experiences of many low-income parents and carers. ""Parents have found their spending increases, as some of the usual strategies they use to get by on a low income - shopping around for the best deal, going to families and friends for a meal when the cupboards are empty - have become suddenly impossible,"" she said. For Shirley Widdop, an increase in food costs has been one of the biggest issues. The disabled single parent, who lives in Keighley, now has to shield for health reasons. That means using online deliveries a lot.  She says: ""There's a minimum basket size [with online orders]. You often have to bulk buy in case there's a problem getting delivery slots.""  When not shielding, Shirley would seek out food in her supermarket's reduced-price section. ""There used to be just a couple of people. Now there are crowds,"" she says. ""Not everyone has easy access to the internet. And not everyone has a functioning bus service."" The report notes that the pandemic has been marked by a huge reduction in overall spending, with entertainment and social activities restricted by lockdown. Higher-income households have been the main beneficiaries of this ""enforced saving"", as they spend 40% more of their income on recreation and leisure activities than the poorest fifth of households. The report says that in contrast to this overall picture, the pandemic has in many cases made it more expensive to live on a low income with children. More than one in three (36%) low-income households with children have increased their spending during the pandemic so far, compared with about one in six (18%) who have reduced their spending.  Among high-income households without children, 13% have increased their spending, compared with 40% who have reduced it. The report highlights three main reasons for these extra pressures: Parents with children at home 24 hours a day have seen higher food and energy bills, while the need to entertain them during the lockdowns has brought additional costsHome-schooling has meant extra costs, such as acquiring laptops, paying for internet access and obtaining additional study materialsFamilies' food costs have risen because of fewer in-store promotions, while shielding has meant using more expensive home delivery options or using more expensive local shops closer to home. It should also be noted, the report says, that these extra spending pressures are squeezing living standards that had stagnated even before the pandemic. To ease the burden, the report says the government should be seeking to maintain the Â£20-a-week rise in Universal Credit (UC) into next year. Otherwise, six million households face having their incomes cut by more than Â£1,000.  Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The pandemic has forced society as a whole to spend less and save more. But these broad spending patterns don't hold true for everyone. ""The extra cost of feeding, schooling and entertaining children 24/7 means that, for many families, lockdowns have made life more expensive to live on a low income."" However, a government spokesperson said measures had been put in place to ""ensure that nobody is left behind"", including extra welfare payments, job protection safeguards, the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme, and equipment for home-schooling. ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond,"" the spokesperson said. Sometimes the overall economic figures can not capture the actual on-the-ground financial reality. The pandemic lockdowns have led to a ""K-shaped"" recovery. Across the entire economy, staying at home has meant less capacity to spend on going out and a surge in savings. But the economic picture is both up and down at the same time, depending on which household.  The average picture is composed of wealthier people saving a huge amount and poorer families more squeezed than ever. This report shows how children staying at home have increased food and energy bills. The cost of buying food has increased with fewer store promotions and a requirement to use more expensive local shops. The furlough scheme has kept people paid, but not necessarily on full pay. So the chancellor hopes that the vaccine rollout could unleash pent up demand in the form of huge levels of savings from the already well-off. And yet at the same time, will continue to face pressure over extending support - for example, the Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit.",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:59:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55618528
Covid -19: 'Out for the first time in months' - to get a vaccine," A conference centre in Hertfordshire is one of seven sites around England where mass vaccinations are taking place in the fight against Covid-19. How are the sites working and what was it like for people receiving the jab? Margaret Austin has left her house for the first time in six months. After receiving an invitation letter on Saturday, the 86-year-old was first in the queue at Robertson House in Stevenage on Monday morning. Ms Austin, who lives 19 miles (30km) away in Broxbourne, says: ""It's really strange being out for the first time in six months. A funny feeling but I'm really, really pleased and relieved to be getting my vaccine."" Moments after the needle is taken out of her arm, the great-grandmother says: ""I feel fine. I didn't even feel it. It was so easy."" What is her message to people thinking about getting the vaccine? ""Just come - the sooner it's done the better,"" says Ms Austin, a former carer who worked for Enfield Council. The council-run Stevenage site is one of seven mass vaccination centres in England, with others in Newcastle, Manchester, London, Epsom, Bristol and Birmingham. The centre says the opening day was fully booked within three hours and it is expecting to vaccinate hundreds of people a day. Currently, most of the people attending are aged 80 and over. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said 14 million of those most at risk from Covid-19 in the UK, along with health and care workers, should be vaccinated by mid-February, at a rate of more than 2 million each week. At Robertson House, people will be able to receive their vaccine from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT, seven days a week.  How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Seven mass vaccination hubs announced for EnglandFamilies 'on their knees' says support charity Nurses, doctors, physios and other NHS staff working nearby will also be able to receive their vaccination at the site, along with social care and care home workers. Joy Sheppard, 82, says she made the 34-mile (55km) trip from Tring to have her jab after booking her slot on Saturday. The retired NHS worker has a son who has been ""heavily shielding"", as has her husband, who is also 82. The prospect of eventually being fully vaccinated against the virus would ""make such a difference"" to her life, she says. She describes the set-up at Robertson House as ""excellent"".  Gerald Rose, from Radlett, agrees, saying ""everything is well-organised"".  He says he ""didn't feel a thing"" after receiving his dose of the vaccine. The 84-year-old, who has been isolating with his wife, says the jab gives ""added reassurance"" and is a ""great relief"".  ""I'm lucky, being an old man and being called before a lot of people, but I feel fine and I'm pleased it's arrived, and I hope it [the pandemic] will all be over soon,"" he says. From buttoning up against the wind and cold in the queue outside Robertson House, to peeling off the layers and exposing an upper arm.  A reminder perhaps that getting here has been a journey from despair to hope. This centre and others like them, the government and scientists tell us, will be our route out of this pandemic and all its misery. And if the wait outside was the worst bit, no-one was complaining about getting their jab inside. The atmosphere in the hub? Calm and professionalism, with room for a cradling arm here, a listening ear there. The NHS invited over-80s from within 45 minutes of the centre to book a jab. That, according to some local politicians, will have been too much for some. But from those who did turn up - and slots booked up in just a few hours over the weekend - I heard nothing but determination to get their jab and beat the virus. Heather Gallagher, from Hitchin, says receiving her Covid vaccine was ""no problem at all"". The 93-year-old was brought to the centre by neighbour Mark Parry, 52, who has been supporting her throughout the pandemic, such as buying a weekly shop. He says he has noticed the impact isolation has had on his neighbour over the past year. Mr Parry says the vaccine is ""going to be such a boon"" for Ms Gallagher, adding: ""She's seen none of her friends for a year."" ""This will really, really help. She'll be able to go back to church again. She'll be able to get her independence back, doing some shopping and basically start to see her friends, and I think that's the most important thing mentally wise for her and I can't wait for it to happen,"" he says. Caroline Shepherd, the clinical expert for immunisations for Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust (HCT), says it had been ""months in the planning"" but getting to the opening day has been a bit ""frantic"" and ""we've had to immobilise quickly"". ""But the NHS is resilient and we are used to this, and this is what we are best at, we are all very good at responding in an emergency and we have,"" she says. She says it has been a ""really emotional"" day as ""lots of the patients haven't been out for several months, lots of them haven't seen family or friends, lots of them haven't been able to do their social activities, so this to them is the beginning of the end"". ""We have all gone through this past year of living and working in this pandemic, and now there's finally some hope for everybody, staff and patients,"" she says. Along with the Stevenage site, mass vaccination centres are now open in the Centre for Life in Newcastle, the Etihad Tennis Centre in Manchester, the ExCel in London, the Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey, Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol and Millennium Point in Birmingham. The seven centres will run alongside the hundreds GP-led centres and hospital sites where the vaccines are being administered. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Covid: Rule change allows parents to stay in hotels to see children," The government has changed coronavirus rules, allowing parents to stay in hotels so they can visit their child if they do not live with them. Previously parents could visit children during lockdown, but restrictions prevented them from staying overnight. The change, which came into force on Boxing Day, applies throughout lockdown in England and for all future tiers.  It follows a campaign by ex-BBC journalist Tom De Castella, who described the new rule as ""great news"". He said ""the worst aspect"" of the pandemic for him had been ""the way it has affected my ability to see my daughter"". Postcode check: Find out the rules where you liveWhat is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home?Children can still visit separated parents Mr De Castella added: ""She's three-years-old and lives in north Norfolk with her mum. I live in south London [and] the drive is about three and a half hours each way.  ""It's a long day. To do it two days running is a killer."" In November, he tried to book into a hotel in Norwich to allow him to see his daughter over successive days, only to be told it was not allowed.  ""Going as a separated parent was deemed to be a 'leisure' purpose by the hotel [and] only keyworkers could stay,"" the freelance journalist added. ""I checked the rules, there was nothing to treat me as an exemption to the lockdown rules. It had a massive bearing on seeing my daughter."" Mr De Castella said it was ""absurd"" that the rules treated seeing his daughter as a leisure activity.  ""This is about building a bond with your child, it's crucial to their development,"" he added.  ""It was massively frustrating for me. For my job I was allowed to go up there and stay in a hotel. But to stay there to spend time with my daughter after months apart was effectively banned."" But he welcomed the change in rules, saying: ""It's great news that at least this anomaly has now been corrected.""

Covid-19: The challenges of home-schooling," A mother wakes at dawn to copy out worksheets for her children on to pieces of paper. Secondary school pupils attempt to write essays on their mobile phones, while younger children queue to wait their turn on the one computer in the house. That, according to the Child Poverty Action Group, was the reality of remote learning in some homes in the first UK lockdown in March 2020. ""We spoke to thousands of parents, carers and children and the thing we heard was that up to  40% of them did not only not have access to a laptop or the internet, but also to other things like printers, even stationery and craft materials,"" said Kate Anstey, a project lead at the charity. Now, as we enter another lockdown that could last until the February half-term or beyond, the government wants even more online learning - with schools mandated to provide at least three hours per day and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson calling on parents to report schools who are not providing enough resources. How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Lockdown Learning: What's the BBC doing to help children?How parents plan to tackle home-schooling It is estimated that 2.6 million schoolchildren live below the poverty line in England alone, and Ofcom estimates that about 9% of children in the UK - between 1.1 million and 1.8 million - do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home. More than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection. Businesses and charities are helping out. The London Grid for Learning (LGfL) has a scheme called Bridge the Divide, which is leading a nationwide procurement scheme for two million cheap Chromebooks and WinBooks. And to help those without devices, the government has sent out more than half a million laptops to the schools in most need.  But the government help ""isn't going far enough,"" thinks Ms Anstey, and even when laptops are arriving, the problems aren't over.  ""We have heard from schools that have had laptops, but they have arrived without the right software,"" she said. To help parents struggling to afford data, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone are planning free access to the Oak National Academy online lessons, so that families can continue to learn from home without using any of their mobile data allowance until the end of the academic year. The networks are completing their technical tests over the coming weeks before rolling it out. Do what you can. You don't have to become a teacher. You are a parent and what your child needs most is what parents give best - love and support.  Provide a structure to the day - this does not need to be a strict timetable. And for younger children, keep the afternoons free for more fun activities, craft, cooking, PE. If you can, set up a small workstation for your child. Headphones could help for online lessons. If you have a Playstation or Xbox, but not an extra computer, both Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom can be accessed via the consoles. Talking and reading don't need devices - and both are vital skills. Practise the basics, like multiplication tables, playing with money, or imaginative role-play. Matt Lawson lives in Cumbria and has four children of school age. His broadband and mobile signal is so bad that he has to rely on the schools his children attend sending work by post. For his daughter, studying for GCSEs it is particularly hard. ""She was also involved in a lot of clubs which are carrying on on Zoom so she can't join in. It is ridiculous."" Some schools are ahead of the game because they embraced the digital curriculum before the pandemic. Phil Hedger is chief executive of the LEO Academy Trust, a group of six schools in the London Borough of Sutton. Back in 2018, it decided to provide every child with a Chromebook, and in lockdown has found children have thrived because they were used to the technology. ""What works online is high-quality short bursts of teacher-led learning for 15 or 20 minutes, and then offline activities,"" he said. Not all lessons the school provides are live. Some are pre-recorded and there is a plethora of excellent resources already online from places such as BBC Bitesize for teachers to draw on. One Monday, the BBC is also launching curriculum-based programmes for primary and secondary school children, on terrestrial TV channels CBBC and BBC Two. If teachers do provide live lessons, they stay online afterwards to help children who are struggling.  And children know the etiquette of video conferencing, including how to mute themselves and even setting up their own meetings to support their peers. For children without access to the internet, the school provides dongles for a mobile connection. Jonty Clark is chief executive of the Beckmead Trust, which caters for 400 vulnerable children with complex needs. He took matters into his own hands and secured funding from two charities to supply laptops and dongles to both their own and partner schools at the beginning of the first lockdown. It paid dividends. Some of the older children were ""already involved with the justice system"", he said, and having laptops has kept them off the streets and stopped them offending. And for some children, such as those with autism, working at home on a laptop has seen them ""flourish"" academically. I'm just coming up for air after painstakingly copying 17 circles divided into various fractions on to a piece of paper for my seven-year-old to colour in because yup, my printer has packed up. My children are both in primary school. We have yet to have any ""live"" lessons - instead we get pre-recorded videos, Powerpoint presentations and other materials shared on Google Classroom. They also have to play online maths and spelling games. The boys have separate log-ins and are in different years, so need at least one device each. Because there is still a focus on handwriting, I have to submit photos of their work. This is proving tricky because their Google Classroom log-ins do not enable me to access my own Google drive . So far, I am emailing photos to myself from my phone, putting them on my desktop and then uploading them from there. My nine-year-old declares that he is doing more work in home-school than he did in ""real"" school - although he is delighted with his new-found knowledge that he can look up ""naughty words"" in the dictionary. It feels like half-term is a long way away. ""The last few days have been some of the most stressful of my life,"" one parent, who didn't want to be named, told the BBC. Both he and his wife work full-time, but now have to fit in live spelling lessons, Powerpoint presentations and spreadsheets. In desperation at the sheer workload, he has had to turn to his 60-year-old mother for help. She has previously had health issues, so the solution is not without risk. Parenting expert Harriet Shearsmith thinks families should take the resources from schools but adapt them to their own routine and the needs of their child. With a five-year-old, an eight-year-old and a nine-year-old, she summed up the frustration of many. ""Today I spent 90 minutes on a maths sheet looking at a long multiplication which I didn't even get myself. ""It is all well and good to say children have to learn for three hours, but I challenge the MPs who came up with this to make three different children work for three hours while doing your own job.""",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 01:19:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55573803
Covid: The truth behind videos of 'empty' hospitals," Multiple videos posted online claim to show empty hospitals in the UK as evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has been exaggerated.  It has provoked a strong reaction from healthcare officials, who have encouraged the public to heed government advice as coronavirus infections surge - putting pressure on the NHS. Responding to a question about hospital beds being empty, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""When people say that, that is a lie.""   They're mostly filmed by individuals walking through quiet hospital corridors and are being posted in Facebook groups and on the Twitter feeds of coronavirus sceptics and anti-lockdown activists. There have been videos taken of dozens of locations and some have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.  The number of Covid patients has increased significantly in recent weeks and there are serious concerns about the NHS's ability to cope with the surge. However, because of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals, often separating Covid patients from others, and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings will currently look empty.  That doesn't mean hospitals aren't busy. How busy are hospitals in England?Ambulance waiting times in parts of England 'off the scale' We've examined videos from two different locations and sought responses to them from the hospitals. A video posted on social media purports to show an empty Croydon University Hospital, with a commentary claiming that the government is exaggerating the scale of the pandemic.   The video, posted in three parts, has been viewed thousands of times and shared across multiple anonymous social media accounts. It has prompted other users to make comments below the post that their local hospitals are empty too.   Croydon University Hospital is a large centre treating patients on a 24-hour basis.  In a statement in response to the video posts, the hospital trust said: ""Contrary to videos circulating online claiming to show our hospital is empty, our services remain extremely busy.""  The video starts with the camera entering the main reception room through signs saying ""NO ENTRY"".  'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Whitty The main reception area has a closed coffee shop and the person filming says: ""I've never seen this place so empty."" Responding to the footage, a spokesperson for Croydon Health Services told us: ""We have a one-way system in the main entrance to help with social distancing when entering or leaving the hospital. The video shows this person arriving via the exit. ""The video was also filmed overnight, when the coffee shops would be closed and when we would expect to see our corridors less busy,"" they added.   The video shows empty corridors. But there's a good reason the corridors are empty. ""We provide this care in our wards and in other clinical areas - not corridors or waiting rooms,"" said the hospital spokesperson.  The man then walks around the outside of the A&E waiting room. ""Urgent treatment - empty. Look at this place,"" says the individual, filming the outside of a waiting room which looks fairly full of people sitting socially distanced.  ""Regarding the A&E waiting area, the video shows only the entrance to the department,"" said the hospital. ""Patients brought in by ambulance, or those in a serious condition or requiring admission to hospital, are unlikely to be waiting in this area. ""Perpetuating myths and rumours only undermines their [NHS staff] hard work. It also risks the spread of misinformation, which could lead people to risk their own health and the health of their loved ones,"" said the hospital official.  Another set of videos, posted on Twitter but without commentary, shows an individual walking down apparently empty corridors of the Princess Royal Hospital in Bromley on - it's claimed - New Year's Day.  The NHS says the footage ""misrepresents what is really happening"".  Four clips have been uploaded of someone passing down a corridor with a sign for the critical care unit, with a twitter thread referring to ""spare beds"" and the ""closed bereavement unit"" along with the hashtag ""film your hospital"". The videos have been watched tens of thousands of times, but reveal very little about how this particular hospital is dealing with the pandemic. In response, the King's College NHS Trust say the parts of the hospital dealing with the pandemic are extremely busy: ""This corridor is not representative of what is happening in wards across the hospital, which have seen a more than ten-fold increase in Covid admissions in the space of a month."" The bereavement suite, briefly shown in one of the videos, is apparently closed. But according to the Princess Royal University hospital website, it shuts at 4pm and on bank holidays. In a further clip, the person filming the video appears to enter an urgent care centre and on Twitter questions whether it is ""overrun"". The room looks relatively full of people. One particular Facebook group in the UK dedicated to sharing pictures and videos of empty hospitals, had more than 13,000 members.    This group was taken down by Facebook on 8 January. Another similar group subsequently set up was taken down by Facebook on 11 January. The administrators of the original group appear to be linked to another Facebook page promoting a baseless conspiracy about the global Covid pandemic, known as the 'Great Reset' theory. In March last year, several viral videos purported to show empty hospitals across the United States, with the hashtag 'film your hospital' being tweeted by thousands of accounts.  This sparked a trend that has been repeated in other countries.  These videos in the UK are the latest example of people taking direct action to spread misinformation about the pandemic. The year 2020 ended with a group of people standing outside St Thomas' Hospital in London shouting that the pandemic is a ""hoax"".  One doctor witnessed the gathering and posted on Twitter that he was ""disgusted but mostly heartbroken.""

Smart locks: Convenience comes with security doubts," For Candace Nelson, finding out about smart locks from a friend ""really was a game changer"". People like her, who live with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), often feel a need to perform routines like washing their hands, counting things or checking a door is locked. ""I have quite a few times nearly made it to work and couldn't remember if I locked the door, so I'd turn around,"" she says. On other occasions she has driven for an hour before turning back. ""My brain will not stop until I know for sure,"" explains Miss Nelson, who works for the Girl Scouts in Charleston, West Virginia. But in September she installed a door lock that she can monitor from her smartphone. ""Being able to just look at my phone and feel that sense of comfort really helps put me at ease,"" she says. Smart locks like Kwikset's Kevo began to appear in 2013. Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it. Bluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features. Raising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well. Wi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in.  Connecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers. Using a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale. Worldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (Â£3.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, according to market research firm Statista. Smartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia. Taiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step. More Technology of Business Greener planes of the future... or just pretty plans?Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industryTech trends in 2021: Fast planes and homeworkingCreating animal food from a greenhouse gasA palm oil alternative could help save rainforests But some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough. As principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks. He says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems.  ""I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely."" There is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability.  ""Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,"" he says. Another challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi.  ""Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,"" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks. ""The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,"" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly.  One solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection. It can also be tricky to install smart locks. Yale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws.  Helpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky. ""I'm a bit of a door nerd now,"" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks. For fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy.  One workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether.  A server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. ""The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,"" she says.  Lock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens.  Some want an ""active command and control experience"" using Siri or Alexa.  But others long for locks to ""do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,"" he says. If we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in. They can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.

Royal Mail: Can new boss Simon Thompson turn it around?," Simon Thompson, a former Ocado executive who also ran the NHS Test and Trace app, has been named as Royal Mail's new UK boss. But he faces a tough job reinvigorating the postal service whose last permanent chief executive, Rico Back, quit unexpectedly in May. Royal Mail has struggled to cope with a surge in parcel deliveries during the pandemic which caused delays over Christmas.  The volume of letters it delivers has also continued to fall as people rely more on email and text. The firm has admitted ""failing to adapt"" to the new reality and ""holding on to outdated working practices and a delivery structure that no longer meets customer needs"". Online shopping surge blamed for Royal Mail delaysRoyal Mail boss in surprise exit after two years The hope is that Mr Thompson, who has held customer-service oriented roles at HSBC and Lastminute.com, can bring the service into the 21st Century as it faces fierce competition from within the parcel delivery market. ""Adapting with flexibility is not Royal Mail's strongest point, and it will need to be much more nimble to keep abreast of its customers changing needs and stay in with a chance of keeping up with the competition,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.  Mr Thompson's appointment comes after a tough year for Royal Mail, which last month agreed a pay deal with the Communication Workers Union (CWU), ending a two-year dispute. For the past eight months the company has been run by interim chief executive Stuart Simpson, who took over when Mr Back stepped down after less than two years in the job. Mr Back had faced criticism over his pay and was reportedly running the business from his home in Switzerland at the time of his departure.  The service's problems are deeper rooted, however, with sales having fallen in every year but one since it was privatised in 2014.  Ms Streeter said it had underinvested in new technology for years, leaving it ""playing catch up"" with the competition, despite its dominant position as the UK's universal postal provider. Its Universal Service Obligation - to provide a postal service to all parts of the UK at flat rates - is another burden not faced by its rivals.  ""With the decline in letter writing accelerating, Royal Mail needs to better capitalise on the online shopping boom, but it struggled desperately over the festive period to keep up with the huge demand on its service,"" said Ms Streeter. ""That is likely to have pushed some of its traditional customers into the arms of its rivals, with the likes of Hermes which uses self-employed couriers, proving a tough competitor in terms of price."" According to Dr Paul Simmonds of Warwick Business School, Mr Thompson's experience working for customer-focused businesses such as Apple, Honda and Ocado will be a ""strength"". He also has some knowledge of Royal Mail having been a non-executive director since 2017. ""Top of his 'in tray' is the need to reinvigorate the group's efforts to transform itself,"" Dr Simmonds said. Part of this will involve striking further agreements with the CWU on pay and conditions so it can bring in more efficient work practices, something that will take skill and diplomacy, he said.   ""Of equal importance is the question of what to do with the letters business which is in terminal decline."" It is not all bad news for the business as its international arm, run by Martin Seidenberg, has been performing well. But on Monday, Royal Mail's interim chairman Keith Williams said the firm was in a period of ""significant transition"" and needed to ""move quickly"" to improve its services. Mr Thompson said it had been a ""challenging year"" for Royal Mail, adding: ""Looking ahead, we need to build on the great trust we have on the doorstep. We need to develop a razor-sharp focus on the customer."" Mr Thompson will be paid about 20% less than Mr Back, with a base salary of Â£525,000 and a pension allowance of 13.6%. He will also be eligible to participate in the firm's short-term and long-term incentive plans, taking his total annual remuneration to around Â£1.4m.  Mr Back took home Â£1.7m last year and received a Â£5.8m payout on joining the firm despite shareholder objections.",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:07:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615471
UK leading the way in use of language-learning apps," The popularity of language-learning apps has boomed around the world during the coronavirus lockdowns, and the UK has, somewhat surprisingly, led the way. For a country not renowned for its population's skill or enthusiasm at learning a foreign language, the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have seen many more Britons try their hand at becoming at least a bit bilingual. With lockdowns limiting what we can otherwise do with our leisure time, people have been downloading apps to swap their ""hellos"" for a ""buenos dÃ­as"", ""bonjour"" or ""guten tag"". Londoner Chelsey Hames started using language app Duolingo to learn some French last year. After a few months, the 33-year-old says she ""could suddenly read blocks of French text"". ""While I can't translate word for word, I can now get the idea and sentiment behind the writing. It is absolute magic."" US firm Duolingo says that its new user numbers soared in 2020, especially in the UK. It says that globally they were up 67% compared with 2019, while in the UK they shot up by 132%, almost double the worldwide average. ""The UK has really embraced language learning during the pandemic,"" says Duolingo's UK manager Colin Watkins. Prior to Covid-19 he says the biggest reason British users said they wanted to learn a language was for travelling overseas. But with global travel mostly curtailed, people were now learning because of other factors. ""Since Covid there's been a huge increase in people wanting to learn for a whole variety of reasons - whether that is for [helping with] school, brain training or culture. We have all wanted to do something positive with our time."" For the app's now 13 million UK users, Spanish remains the most popular language that people want to learn, followed by French. Other language apps have also seen big growth. London-based Busuu says that while its active global user numbers tripled last year, numbers in the UK rose more than fourfold (312%). It now has more than three million UK users. Meanwhile, Berlin-based Babbel says its UK user registrations increased by 80% in 2020, compared with a 50% rise worldwide. It now has 10 million customers globally, but did not release a figure for the UK. What Babbel did say is that its data shows that Britons are actually much better at learning a foreign language than their reputation suggests. ""When a lot of Brits say that they are not very good at language learning, that's the first thing that we don't see in our data,"" says Babbel's chief executive Arne Schepker. ""[For Britons], both learning engagement and how much you learn - how easy you find it to build a learning habit, the amount of mistakes and the amount of progress that you make through our material - is absolutely competitive in the international environment."" He adds that Spanish is now the most popular language for its UK users, overtaking French. And that the new top reason why people have signed up is an interest in language learning and other cultures, which has overtaken travel. But why are more British people now learning a new language compared with the global averages? Duolingo's Mr Watkins says there may have been a cultural change. ""The UK now sees real value in learning a language for fun, not because they have to,"" he says. ""People are learning because of culture, brain training, family, and relationships, along with school and travel. We want a positive use of our time, and to do something productive on our phones. Covid gave people the stimulus to do this."" Maria Lievano, a Spanish teacher based in the UK, thinks that Brexit may have also played a factor. ""It is possible that Brexit may have played a part in why the UK, in particular, saw so many people using these apps,"" she says. ""Particularly those who want to give themselves the opportunity to work in, or do business with, other countries now Britain has left the EU,"" she says. ""So with many people at home furloughed, or redundant, this period gave them time to evaluate their future career options, whether to look for work abroad or to improve their skill set. ""And for others, perhaps learning a foreign language is simply a way to dream of the holiday they can't go on due to the pandemic."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. While Duolingo and Busuu both offer free and paid-for premium versions, Babbel is only free for the first week. All three have put a lot of work into their software to try to make the learning process as effective as possible. But are they actually any good? How proficient can people get in another language by using them? Renowned linguist Stephen Krashen, professor emeritus of the University of Southern California, is not very complimentary. ""My analyses of their results show that they achieve the same mediocre results as traditional methods do in regular classrooms, and produce the same lack of enthusiasm from students,"" he says. ""We don't acquire language by speaking or writing, even when we get our errors corrected. Rather, the ability to speak and write fluently and accurately is the result of language acquisition via comprehensible input, such as good books, movies and interesting stories."" Busuu's co-founder Bernhard Niesner admits that ""the best way to learn a language is to be in the country, and be fully able to speak with native speakers"" but says that ""we want to replicate that with Busuu"". He adds that he believes the popularity of language-learning apps is here to stay.  ""We think that this is going to sustain because a lot of people now, for the first time, have used their mobile phone to learn something, and they understand the benefit of it,"" he says. ""It's super flexible, it's personalised, it's much cheaper maybe than traditional learning."" French learner Chelsey Hames says: ""There is something about learning and speaking more than one language that I think brings the world a little closer together."" ""And it feels good to be a part of that, particularly in our current situation.""",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:02:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55562267

Bombay Jungle: How British Asians broke into London's club scene," One evening in 1993, Mits Sahni was standing in a queue in Leicester Square in central London. He was trying to get into a nightclub - but when he got to the front of the line he was turned away by the bouncer.  It wasn't the first time this had happened. He'd tried different approaches - bringing along female friends or wearing smarter clothes. But the result was always the same. ""The doorman would make up excuse after excuse. And after a while you figured out it was due to racism.""  Mits had always been into music.  As a 10-year-old in Ealing, west London, he'd take his boombox and a sheet of lino into school and breakdance to hip-hop in the playground at lunchtime. On Saturday afternoons he'd take tapes he'd edited on his mother's double-cassette hi-fi system to Ealing shopping centre and play them full volume on the stereos in Dixons. Then he'd go to a fast food joint and breakdance for customers in return for a bag of chips. His first experience of clubbing came in 1987. It was a Friday and, now 14, he had bunked off school to go to a daytimer - a music event for British South Asians held in the middle of the day.  About 10 of his friends had left the house that morning in school uniform so as not to raise their parents' suspicion. They met outside a nearby supermarket and went as a group to the Empire Ballroom. It left a deep impression. There were live bands playing bhangra - traditional Punjabi folk music reworked with new electronic production techniques - and DJs who mixed bhangra with reggae, soul and hip hop, creating a new sound. ""You just saw them rocking out a place of 2,000 people,"" Mits says. Another revelation was that divisions in the British South Asian community disappeared. Seeing the younger generation, whatever their backgrounds, moved by the music on the dance floor, he realised: ""So this is how you bring people together.""  But Mits' real love was hip-hop. He bought his first set of turntables with money he saved up from a part-time job at his uncle's luggage shop, and formed a group called Hustlers HC with two friends, Paul and Mandeep, from the gurdwara - the Sikh place of worship he attended on Sundays. Punjabi Sikh men in turbans rapping with politically conscious lyrics on subjects such as racism raised eyebrows on the Asian music scene, where audiences generally expected bhangra, but these songs helped give Mits and his friends ""a sense of identity"", he says. Listen to Mits Sahni in the first episode of the new series of Three Pounds in My PocketCheck out series one to three on the Radio 4 website By the time Mits was standing in the queue in 1993 trying to get into that big London nightclub, he was 20 and had already had some success as a DJ. He was putting on his own events at colleges, which were proving popular. He was also DJ-ing at different locations across the capital. But there still wasn't a regular club night at a well-established venue specifically for a British Asian audience. ""They didn't think that British Asians drank, so they were worried about lack of revenue from alcohol,"" says DJ Ritu, another popular British South Asian DJ. ""They just didn't think that the events would be successful."" And she thinks there was possibly an undertone of racism too.  But then suddenly the Wag Club in Soho, having seen the popularity of daytimers and student union nights for British South Asians, made it known that it was interested in running a weekly British Asian night on Tuesdays. This was a world-renowned club, which attracted stars like Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa and Sade, and welcomed guests such as George Michael, David Bowie and Neneh Cherry through its doors. The Tuesday Asian night was an exciting opportunity, so Mits and his friends, Mark Strippel and Matt Thomas, offered to run it. And their offer was accepted. From being one of those left on the street outside in nearby Leicester Square, Mits was about to become an insider at one of London's coolest nightclubs - albeit on a Tuesday, known as the ""graveyard night"". The first event would be in September and would be called Bombay Jungle. DJ Ritu would be one of the resident DJs. Mits, Matt and Mark went around universities handing out fliers. They weren't sure whether anyone would turn up. But on the first night, there were around 300 people. ""We were like: 'What?!'"" says Mits. ""'People actually coming to see us?'""  In a few weeks, word had got round. Mits says up to 800 people were queuing outside, hours before the event started at 21:30. Coaches were soon coming from Leicester, Birmingham and Manchester. ""It just went from there,"" Mits says. And no-one was turned away unless the club was full up. The clubbers were all dressed in the fashion of the time. The men wore baggy jeans, puffer jackets, shell suits; the women wore black dresses or spangly tops and jeans. There were two floors, one played hip hop, reggae and ragga. Upstairs was bhangra. ""Ironically, Mark looked after the bhangra floor,"" says Mits. ""And there was me and Matt in the downstairs basement, which was the hip hop floor. So it's like the Sikh guy was looking after the hip hop and the white guy was looking after the bhangra."" For British South Asians, Bombay Jungle was an important development. ""What Bombay Jungle did, it allowed all these music genres to come together on the dance floor in the same space of the club. It was a new way to listen and dance to a varied ensemble of music and express oneself on the dance floor in a mainstream space,"" says Rajinder Dudrah, professor of cultural studies and creative industries at Birmingham City University. Most of the British South Asians who came along, Mits says, were university students. ""Suddenly they were free. They had moved out of home, no Mum and Dad to argue with about where you're going - you can get totally drunk, party as much as you like. And that was it. And it was just them experiencing their freedom.""  Any fears that the bar takings would be disappointing were put to rest. ""They drank like fishes,"" Mits laughs.  Bombay Jungle didn't only attract young British South Asians. Mits recalls that some weeks into the launch he was upstairs on the bhangra floor when he saw three Jamaican women. He went up to them and asked if they liked the music. ""We absolutely love it!"" they replied. DJ Ritu says the dance floors at the Wag Club on Bombay Jungle nights were heaving. She smiles as she remembers people with their hands and arms in the air. ""It was very celebratory, very euphoric and tribal. It actually becomes a complete adrenaline rush for a DJ, or it was for me, when you see that kind of energy and euphoria on a dance floor in front of you."" Bombay Jungle lasted for two years at the Wag Club and helped pave the way for British Asian music nights across the country, extending beyond the university scene.  Dr Dudrah says it allowed music creatives ""to spin their vinyls, play their digital beats and mix and match a range of music in their own unique waysâ¦ it helped them develop their careers in the music industry"".   DJ Ritu went on from the Bombay Jungle nights to be one of the founders of Outcaste Records and Club Outcaste, as well as Club Kali for the LGBT community. Talvin Singh, who would go on to win the Mercury Prize in 1997, founded the Anokha club night with Sweety Kapoor in east London, which saw an older, more cosmopolitan crowd. He and other musicians like Punjabi MC and Nitin Sawhney then helped take British South Asian Music into the mainstream. DJ Ritu, who continues to work as a DJ and radio presenter, says the '90s were an important moment for second generation British South Asians. At the start of the decade, she says, there was a sense that it wasn't cool to be Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi. ""We were a set of mixed communities, we weren't a homogenised community, and largely we were marginalised, we were stereotyped, we were easy targets, easy prey for racists. So how many people really wanted to be outwardly and obviously Asian, or wear their Asian-ness on their sleeve with pride?"" she asks. ""I'm not saying there weren't people that did have a lot of pride in their culture. Of course there were. But there were other cultures that were more dominant in terms of fashion, in terms of music, in terms of acceptance and coolness.""  But by the end of the decade, she thinks that had changed.  ""If I look back on my life, the '90s stand out for me as just being absolutely revolutionary,"" says Ritu. ""And just like thinking, yeah, you know, we've done it. We've done it. We're not just a trend that gets picked up for a week or two or even a year. Culturally, we were on the map."" Mits agrees. He's still in the music industry working as a live music promoter. ""Looking back, it was ground-breaking. It was the passion that drove us to break down those boundaries that were put up for us and just knock them down - just to see Asians get into clubs. Now it's all kind of forgotten because the new generation going out don't know about the experiences we went through and the battles we fought.""

Pembrokeshire Murders: Ex-officer on 'squeezing six years into three episodes," When senior detective Steve Wilkins was first told the investigation he led into one of the most notorious killers in modern Welsh history was being made into a primetime television show, his first thought was for the families of those who died, rather than who would be playing him. But that did not stop it coming as a bit of a surprise to the 61-year-old that ITV had cast Hollywood star Luke Evans as the lead in The Pembrokeshire Murders, a three-part drama about a cold case review team pursuing multiple murderer John Cooper. Warning: This article contains spoilers Cooper, who was handed a whole-of-life sentence in 2011 for the murders of brother and sister Richard and Helen Thomas and holidaymakers Peter and Gwenda Dixon, has become known as the Bullseye Killer because of his appearance on the popular darts-themed game show around the time of the murders. The killings, and an attack on a group of teenagers in 1996 which saw a girl raped at knifepoint, had taken place ""within five miles of each other"" near the tip of south-west Wales, Wilkins said, but remained unsolved 20 years after the first crime had taken place. Having just returned to Dyfed-Powys Police after two years working with the National Criminal Intelligence Service, then Det Supt Wilkins said he decided to take another look at the cases ""as nationally, there had been a number of successes on cold case reviews"".  ""I was also aware that a possible suspect, John William Cooper, was serving a 16-year sentence for armed robbery and due for parole.  ""He [had] lived in the same area and my concern was that if he was responsible, he would kill again."" The detective's hunch led to a ""massive investigation"" which saw officers sift through ""almost 5,000 exhibits and 2,000,000 pieces of paper"". ""For the first three years, we didn't get a forensic link,"" recalled Mr Wilkins. ""Then in 2008, a pair of shorts seized from Cooper's house in 1996 were re-examined and a speck of blood was recovered which belonged to Peter Dixon. ""Soon after, [Mr Dixon's] blood was found on a shotgun used by Cooper in a previous robbery."" Those breakthroughs would eventually lead to Cooper being found guilty of all three attacks. Mr Wilkins said he ""never intended to write a book"" about the investigation but, after being approached by ""a number of writers"" interested in the case, he wanted to ""give an accurate, sensitive record"". That decision ultimately led him to discussing the case with Dracula Untold and Beauty and the Beast star Evans over ""a couple of beers"". The actor said recently that telling the story was ""a huge responsibility"" as he ""wanted to tell it right and show justice for the victims"". ""This is a very serious, sad story where four people lost their lives and their families have struggled and suffered greatly because of it."" Mr Wilkins, who now lives back in his native Cheshire, said he was impressed by Evans and the rest of the cast's approach. ""I cannot speak too highly of their understanding, sensitivity and professionalism and commitment to getting it right.  ""They quickly understood that they were depicting real people, many who are still carrying the scars."" He said the Hollywood star had been ""a lovely guy - down to earth and very professional"".  ""Luke wanted to know the detail of the investigation, how I would do and say things and why certain decisions were made.  ""He wanted to know about the victims and their families as he really cares."" Mr Wilkins said it was vital to him that the drama did not ""sensationalise the crimes"". ""It is very difficult to squeeze six years into three episodes, but in doing so, we agreed red lines which must not be crossed... and that has been achieved."" Mr Wilkins said he hoped viewers would take away a sense of ""how committed my team was to achieving justice"". ""As the senior investigating officer, you tend to get the accolades, but I had the privilege to lead a hand-picked team. They were remarkable, as were the scientists led by Angela Gallop and the prosecution team by Gerard Elias QC. ""It will never leave me and I am very proud that... we were able to achieve justice for the victims and their families; they deserved it.  ""I also hope [the audience] can understand the strength of the families and victims who lived through the crimes and court process. ""But most of all, I hope they understand that when it goes wrong, there is a committed, compassionate and professional service that will do its utmost to find the truth and achieve justice.""

Covid lockdown: 'My baby screamed when she saw new faces'," When Rachael Powell's one-year-old daughter met her grandparents for the first time after months of Covid-induced separation, she ""absolutely screamed the place down"" as she ""didn't know who they were"". The 39-year-old was on maternity leave with Emmeline when the first national lockdown was announced in March and she had to shield. ""I was really looking forward to going to coffee shops, meeting other mums and going to baby classes and then everything stopped,"" she says. ""I felt guilty that she didn't get any of that and have that interaction."" The mum from Monton in Greater Manchester is far from alone in having those concerns. Many parents believe their babies' development has been hit by the impact of coronavirus. Baby classes have been cancelled, restarted and cancelled again, while meet-ups with fellow parents now feel like a luxury enjoyed only in the distant past. Rachael says it left her feeling ""cheated"" out of her maternity leave and upset that even simple things like visits from Emmeline's grandparents had become fraught. ""She just screamed - absolutely screamed the place down,"" she says. ""I couldn't leave her in the same room as them. She didn't know who they were."" Rachael says Emmeline had managed to have some interactions with other babies when classes started up again with new Covid-secure guidelines, but it was ""just not the same"" as when she took her baby's seven-year-old brother Charlie to classes when he was her age. ""It was good at first, because she got to do songs and activities, but as a mum, you didn't get anything from it as I was sat so far away from other mums. ""And, as Emmeline was getting bigger and wanting to get off the mat and see other children, the whole thing became about keeping her on the mat."" Liz Osler, who runs Little Groovers music classes in Greater Manchester, agrees that Covid-secure sessions are ""the opposite of what the groups are about really"".  ""Children are usually encouraged to be sociable and come up and select an instrument, but now they're given instruments in a bag and you've got to keep the bag on your mat."" However, she believes it is still worthwhile hosting the sessions, as they give parents somewhere to go during a difficult time.  She says everyone was ""so happy to be able to do something normal, even though it's not normal"", but reorganising her business had meant ""massive financial outlay"" on items such as headsets and loud speakers and on booking larger venues to allow for social distancing. She says running the classes also means she is ""on pins all the time"". ""Before Covid, I was in the moment... and now the music is the last thing on my mind [as] all I'm doing is thinking about everyone's safety. ""I can't wait for when children can be sociable with each other and we can blow bubbles and just enjoy the music together. ""You just want to fast-forward to when it's all over."" Delimar Recio, who is originally from Venezuela and lives in Walkden, Greater Manchester says that pressure of having to second guess her one-year-old daughter Sabrina's interactions is hard. The 31-year-old says while it was ""frustrating"" to have a burgeoning support network taken away when the first lockdown was announced, the easing of restrictions was also stressful because of Sabrina's natural curiosity. ""She wanted to reach out and touch the other babies and crawl towards them,"" she says. ""I had to hold her back and she was crying.  ""I thought 'what is the point if she was going to get upset all the time?'."" Education consultant and child psychologist Dr Paul Kelly says classes and meet-ups are vital to a baby's development and Covid was having a ""massive impact"".  ""We are social creatures, social beings - it is pre-programmed in our brains,"" he says. ""When children's brains are stimulated, they grow."" Dr Kelly says there is also an impact on parents, who are missing out on ""mutual support"", adding: ""An informal get-together is massive in terms of benefitting both parent and child."" For him, people should ""grab what they can, when they can"" during these uncertain times and focus on ""how you can enhance [your baby's] development... rather than spending time thinking about how your child might be behind"". Both mums say they have been surprised by what their daughters now take in their strides. Rachael says Emmeline ""just clung on to me"" when she first started nursery and was ""quite teary"", but, ""after a week or two"", stopped crying and settled in, while Delimar says Sabrina is now used to video-calling and is slowly getting used to meeting more people. ""After the first lockdown, she'd cry if she saw a new person,"" she says. ""Now she's more friendly."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Dry January: Will lockdown cause more people to give in?," Dry January, when drinkers aim to abstain from alcohol for a whole month, was designed to ""reset"" people's relationship with booze.  It's a period of abstinence many felt they needed in 2021 - the pandemic has led to people drinking more alcohol, according to research from Alcohol Change UK. The charity found that one in three of us believes we drank in excess last year compared with 2019. Sadly, for some, England's latest lockdown has made Dry January seem like an impossible challenge this year. ""This time last year I did Dry January, and it was easy, I enjoyed it,"" explains Sarah Wassell. ""But I fell off the wagon on day two [of 2021] - it was just too hard with this lockdown.""  The 53-year-old, who lives with her husband and three children in Twickenham, south-west London, says she has particularly felt the pressure of home schooling during the pandemic. ""I found that some days I was rewarding myself with a chilled glass of rosÃ©. One glass would often lead to two.""  Towards the end of the first lockdown, Sarah was drinking every day and when the rosÃ© ran out, she started on the vodka  ""It felt like a coping mechanism and still does. A cup of tea for an evening doesn't really do it for me,"" she says. Christie Negus, who lives in Surrey, says she will also be giving Dry January a miss this year. ""I am drinking more as I feel angry with the government. I am drinking at least three bottles of wine a week and one bottle of gin or whisky, or sometimes both"", the 66-year-old says. Her friend is also dying of cancer, and he is just 52. ""I have a drink just to remember the good times we had,"" she said. Christie is also struggling with not being able to see her family. ""The drink definitely helps you get through it... I am turning to booze more because it numbs the pain and now we are in lockdown again, I will probably drink more,"" she says. Kitty Aurora, from Manchester, says she was ""pretty teetotal"" until June but then things changed. ""I lost my house, job and suddenly became a single mum all in lockdown. I ended up having one of the worst breakdowns of my life and put myself in danger and struggled with mental health issues,"" she explains. She has been diagnosed with mental illnesses including PTSD, leading to her taking strong medication.  ""I'm not going to beat myself up for failing [Dry January] because living in lockdown whilst navigating single parenthood and mental illnesses is tough enough,"" the 27-year-old says. 'I found myself pouring a glass of wine at 2pm''He drinks six bottles of wine a day'Does Dry January lead to Binge February? Even with the struggles of lockdown, a record number of people have signed up to the official Dry January challenge, which is run by Alcohol Change UK. Some 6.5 million people said they would be taking part, a 67% rise compared to last year. Dr Richard Piper, the charity's chief executive, said: ""Since news broke of the new lockdown, some have rushed to say that 'Dry January is cancelled'. ""Yet what we're actually seeing is a jump in the number of people coming to our website to download the free app and sign up for our daily emails. So it looks like more people are taking on Dry January."" He says that in 2020 the charity noticed ""a steep increase in the number of people drinking in ways that put their health at risk"", but adds that it's ""brilliant news that one in four of us plans to cut down in 2021"". Tony Rao is a consultant psychiatrist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Here are his tips to help you make the most of your month off - even during lockdown - and make a change that lasts: Be clear about why you're doing it Whether you're sick of hangovers, want to sleep more deeply, want to save money or you have a health and fitness goal, it can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily. It will keep you going if the going gets tough.  Work out your triggers Many of us will have found ourselves with new triggers, or maybe with existing triggers being pulled more often or earlier in the day to drink. If you can work out what your triggers are, you can make sure you're ready for them when they rear their heads.  Treat yourself Many of us use alcohol as our go-to way to have fun, de-stress or treat ourselves - our trigger response. This is an important association to break. What other treats could you have stored up for your Dry January?  You're not alone Taking on 31 days alcohol-free with support from Alcohol Change UK, the charity behind Dry January, doubles your chance of staying totally dry for the full month, and having ongoing benefits six months later. The charity offers the free Try Dry app, which lets you track your units, calories and money saved through Dry January. Think about the future you It can be helpful to think of Dry January as a boot camp for developing a healthier relationship with alcohol long term. A quarter of people who drink alcohol want to cut down in 2021, and evidence shows that Dry January is a great way to do that.

Reading stabbings: Khairi Saadallah jailed for park murders," A killer who stabbed three men to death in a Reading park has been handed a whole-life jail term. Khairi Saadallah murdered James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and 39-year-old Joe Ritchie-Bennett, in June last year in Forbury Gardens. London's Old Bailey previously heard the 26-year-old ""executed"" the men as an ""act of religious jihad"". Passing sentence Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said it was a ""ruthless and brutal"" terror attack. Saadallah, who admitted the murders, had also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of three other men who were also in the park. The judge said the victims ""had no chance to react, let alone defend themselves"". He said he was sure the attack ""involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning"" and was carried out ""for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause"". BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, who was in court, said the families of James Furlong and David Wails were present, while Joseph Ritchie-Bennett's loved ones watched via a link from America. Saadallah showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney went through his sentencing remarks.  On the afternoon of 20 June, the park was busy due to the first lockdown restrictions being relaxed in England.  Andrew Cafe, who witnessed the stabbings, said he saw Saadallah wielding the ""biggest kitchen knife"" and charging towards him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"".  Pharmaceutical manager Mr Ritchie-Bennett and teacher Mr Furlong died from single stab wounds to their necks, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed once in the back.  Despite treatment from paramedics and doctors, all three friends, who were members of the LGBT community, died at the scene. Three other people - Nishit Nisudan, Patrick Edwards and Stephen Young - were also injured, before Saadallah threw away the knife and fled the scene, pursued by police.  Following his arrest, Saadallah initially said he wanted to plead guilty to the ""jihad that I done"", but the prosecution claimed he later feigned mental illness in police interviews. At a previous hearing, the court heard he had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder, with his behaviour worsened by alcohol and cannabis misuse. But the judge said it was ""clear that the defendant did not, and does not, have any major mental illness"".  Reading attack: 'We did all we could to save them'Reading killer left jail two weeks before attackReading stabbings: Who were the victims? An examination of Saadallah's phone revealed an interest in extremist material, including images of the flag of Islamic State and Jihadi John, the court previously heard.  While at HMP Bullingdon in 2017, he was seen to associate with radical preacher Omar Brookes, who has connections with banned terrorist organisation Al-Muhajiroun.  The court heard Saadallah, who arrived in Britain from Libya in 2012, had previously been involved with militias who had been part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, and was pictured handling weapons, including firearms. Since seeking asylum in Britain, he had been repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences, including theft and assault, between 2013 and 2020. He briefly came to the attention of MI5 in 2019, but the information provided did not meet the threshold of investigation. Saadallah had been released from prison on 5 June, days before the attack, the court heard. On 17 June, he researched the location for his attack online and carried out reconnaissance in the park.  The following day his probation officer alerted his mental health team over comments he made about magic.  A day later, Saadallah contacted the crisis team himself, but when they visited he did not answer.  Following concerns from his brother, police visited the killer the same day, but he told officers he was ""alright"" while he stood near a knife he bought from a supermarket. After the sentencing, James Furlong's father, Gary, said: ""The secretary of state needs to tell us why this guy wasn't put into some form of detention centre before they could deport him.  ""He was not safe to be released back on the streets."" Referring to the fact that Saadallah had been visited by police the night before the attack, Mr Furlong said: ""Given the volume of crimes he's committed and the information that they had on him, for an assessment to be done the night before to say that he's not a danger to the public - it is beyond me."" He described Mr Furlong, originally from Liverpool, as ""a lovely man, loved by his family, idolised by his mother"". David Wails' brother Andrew said: ""For us as a family it's been devastating to lose our much loved son, brother and uncle."" In a statement, the Bennett family described Mr Ritchie-Bennett as a ""devoted and loving husband"" and ""a man who cared strongly about family"". Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, described Saadallah as ""a committed jihadist"". She said: ""He has caused unspeakable hurt and distress to the families of the three men who were brutally murdered as they were relaxing and enjoying socialising with friends on a Saturday evening. ""I'm sure there will also be lasting effects on those who were injured in the attack, who were fortunate not to have been even more seriously harmed."" Reading Borough Council leader Jason Brock described the attacks as ""horrific"" and ""senseless"" and said a permanent memorial to the victims was planned.",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:00:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-55622476
Covid in Scotland: Sturgeon urges football not to 'abuse privileges'," First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged football clubs not to ""abuse"" the privileges they are afforded while the rest of Scotland is in lockdown. Players and staff from Celtic FC are having to self-isolate after one tested positive for Covid-19 on return from a mid-season training camp in Dubai. Ms Sturgeon said she had doubts about whether the trip was really necessary. And she said ""everyone, including football, should be erring on the side of caution"" amid a rise in infections. Scottish football below Championship level is to be suspended for three weeks in light of the current lockdown, with Scottish Cup and lower league ties to be rescheduled. Live: Celtic in crisis after Covid-19 isolation orderSturgeon warns professional sport 'all bets are off' Top flight football in Scotland is continuing while most Scots are subject to a ""stay at home"" order due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Celtic's home fixture against Hibernian is to go ahead on Monday evening, despite the club having lost 13 players and three staff to Covid-19 issues. Defender Christopher Jullien tested positive for the virus on return from the club's training camp in Dubai, with others including the club's manager Neil Lennon being forced to isolate as close contacts. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed and frustrated"" that her daily coronavirus briefing was again being ""dominated by football"". She said she had doubts about whether Celtic's trip ""was really essential"" and whether rules were strictly adhered to, saying it was for the footballing authorities to decide if further action was necessary. The first minister issued a warning to clubs that they must stick to the rules set out for them while the rest of the populace is subject to tight restrictions. She said: ""Football and elite sport more generally enjoys a number of privileges right now that the rest of us don't have. These privileges include the right to go to overseas training camps and be exempt from quarantine on return.  ""It is really vital, obviously for public health reasons but also I think out of respect for the rest of the population living under really heavy restrictions, that these privileges are not abused."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross is an assistant referee in the game. He said that at a time when people are staying at home football games were something many looked forward to.  Mr Ross said: ""We don't want to see the whole of Scottish football affected by the actions of one club."" He also called for financial support to be made available to clubs in the Scottish lower leagues and Scottish Cup who had had their games suspended for three weeks. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was currently in ""the most perilous and serious position since the start of the pandemic"", with a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. She said everyone should be doing their utmost not to add to pressure on the health services by following the rules. She said: ""This whole episode should underline how serious the situation we are in now is. Everyone including football should be erring on the side of caution.  ""I know fans of other clubs feel very strongly that the whole of football should not pay the price for the actions of any one club, and I agree with that.  ""But of course a situation like this does make it essential for us to review the rules - including those around travel exemptions - and that's what we will be doing. As we do, I do hope that Celtic themselves will reflect seriously on all of this."" Ms Sturgeon cited photographs which emerged of players socialising in Dubai, but Celtic's assistant manager John Kennedy said these created a ""false picture"" and that there had been ""minor slip-ups"" at worst. The club had previously claimed the government had given permission for the trip to go ahead, but Ms Sturgeon said it had only provided guidance to the footballing authorities on the rules. She said: ""It's not our role to give approval or not to what a football club is doing."" A statement posted on the Celtic website said that ""the reality is that a case could well have occurred had the team remained in Scotland"". It added: ""Celtic has done everything it can to ensure we have in place the very best procedures and protocols. From the outset of the pandemic, Celtic has worked closely with the Scottish government and Scottish football and we will continue to do so.""

"Coronavirus: Number of Covid-19 jabs given in NI reaches 91,954"," A total of 91,954 vaccines had been administered in Northern Ireland by Monday evening, the Health Department has said. Of those, 68,664 have had a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with 13,949 receiving a second. A total of 9,341 people have received the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at home can now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. The booking process opened on Monday and the jab is available immediately to health trust care workers and those employed in the independent sector. Chief social worker Sean Holland encouraged care workers ""to avail of the vaccine as soon as they can"". The department said on Monday that the vaccination programme was a ""massive and long-term logistical undertaking that is progressing well"". It said there was ""much more work to be done and the programme will be scaled up rapidly as more vaccines become available"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine?No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunkedHow do the Covid vaccines compare? Last week GPs in Northern Ireland began to provide vaccines to people aged over 80, with the aim of offering the jab to everyone in that age group by the end of January. Health officials have told BBC News NI that the past 48 hours were the busiest for hospitals since the start of the pandemic, with appeals made to off duty-staff to go to work to help ease the pressure. In a message to care workers, Mr Holland said he was ""immensely grateful to all who work in this sector for your dedication"". ""Throughout the pandemic you have shown bravery, skill and commitment,"" he added. ""Those in receipt of homecare are often amongst the most vulnerable in our communities and you have been there for them throughout this pandemic."" He said care workers would receive an initial dose of the vaccine as part of the plan by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to protect more people sooner. The Department of Health said dental, pharmacy and optometry workers would be offered the chance to book a vaccine shortly. Health officials are working with pharmacies to enable them to ""play a full and active part"" in providing vaccines to the public.",BBC News - UK,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:20:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55616631
Covid: Gwynedd care home 'frightened' over vaccine delay," A care home manager is ""frightened"" for the residents after its delivery of Covid vaccinations failed to arrive. Lorna Jones said Meddyg Care Dementia Home in Criccieth, Gwynedd, was due to have a delivery of the new Oxford/AstraZeneca jab a week ago. However the vaccine has not arrived amid claims other people in the area have already had the jab. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board admitted there had been ""logistical problems"" in north west Wales. The health board insisted it is ""committed"" to vaccinating those most vulnerable.  On Monday, it was announced that all over-50s in Wales are to be offered jab by spring, after criticism the rollout of the vaccine in Wales has been slower than in other parts of the UK.

Ms Jones said: ""I can't understand why Betsi Cadwaladr have veered away from the priority list. ""It's very clear. If there are vaccines coming into the local community, which there are, why have our residents not been vaccinated? ""I know some care homes have had it in Caernarfon, so why haven't we. What's the difference?"" Ms Jones said the delay is causing concern among staff, residents and families. ""I'm frightened for our residents. I'm getting a lot of contact from families and I just can't give them anything,"" she said. The care home said it has since received an email to say it could be up to two weeks until the vaccine arrives.  Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it is working to ensure those with the highest priority are vaccinated. Teresa Owen, the health board's executive director of public health, said: ""Last week we vaccinated nearly 10,000 people in north Wales. ""This week, staff from primary care practices will be going into the local nursing and residential homes to administer the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccination to residents.

"Retail sales in 2020 worst on record, says BRC trade body"," Retailers suffered their worst annual sales performance on record in 2020, driven by slump in demand for fashion and homeware products, figures show. While food sales growth rose 5.4% on 2019, non-food fell about 5%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It meant an overall fall of 0.3% in a year dominated by the Covid-19 impact, the worst annual change since the BRC began collating the figures in 1995. Christmas offered little cheer, with much of the High Street still closed. ""Physical non-food stores, including all of non-essential retail, saw sales drop by a quarter compared with 2019,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. ""Christmas offered little respite for these retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period,"" she said. The 5.4% rise in food sales was fuelled by shoppers flocking to supermarkets and online grocers to ensure they were stocked up during the pandemic. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better''Worst year for High Street job losses in 25 years' In December, total retail sales increased by 1.8% as shoppers spent more in the run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like sales for the month were up 4.8% as overall shop takings were still affected by restrictions and temporary closures. Online non-food sales jumped by 44.8% in December, according to the new figures, as a higher proportion of shopping took place online. The BRC's sales monitor is collated with the consultancy KPMG, whose UK head of retail, Paul Martin, said: ""In the most important month for the retail industry, there was some positive growth due to the ongoing shift of expenditure from other categories such as travel and leisure. ""Once again we saw big swings in the types of products being purchased and the channels used for shopping, with much of the growth taking place online, where nearly half of all non-food purchases were made."" But he warned that the new lockdown would worsen conditions for many non-essential shops and the High Street generally. Last week, a report from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) said that 2020 was the worst for High Street job losses in more than 25 years, as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost last year, up by almost a quarter from 2019, the CRR said.",BBC News - Business,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55625246
Covid-19: New test rule for UK arrivals from Friday," Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will be required for everyone travelling to the UK from 04:00 GMT on Friday.  People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. All those arriving from places not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. There are issues with testing availability and capacity, so some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda for six days. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently.  Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'UAE dropped from UK travel corridor listWhy is the UK bringing in travel testing? The government said all forms of PCR test would be accepted, as would other forms of test ""with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity"". The announcement comes after a further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Monday. There were also 46,169 cases reported.  More than 32,000 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Also on Monday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs the UK economy would ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic.

Marks & Spencer snaps up Jaeger fashion brand," Marks & Spencer has announced that it has bought the Jaeger fashion brand, which fell into administration last November.  M&S is taking on the brand, but not Jaeger's scores of shops and concessions.  It is now in the process of finalising a deal to buy its products and ""supporting marketing assets"".  M&S announced in May 2020 that it planned to stock other complementary brands to boost sales.  Since then, it has started to sell products online from the Early Learning Centre, as well as from two designers, Nobody's Child and Ghost London.  Richard Price, managing director of M&S Clothing & Home, said: ""We have set out our plans to sell complementary third party brands as part of our Never the Same Again programme to accelerate our transformation and turbocharge online growth.  ""In line with this, we have bought the Jaeger brand and are in the final stages of agreeing the purchase of product and supporting marketing assets from the administrators of Jaeger Retail Limited. We expect to fully complete later this month."" In a call with journalists last week, chief executive Steve Rowe said M&S wanted to partner with other brands, largely for its online business, but stressed: ""We have no intention of turning into a department store.""  Jaeger had 244 staff and some 63 stores and concessions. In addition, 13 stores closed after administrators were appointed, with the loss of more than 120 posts across stores, head office and distribution.  It is unclear if any jobs will be saved. There has been no update from the administrators, FRP.  Jaeger was founded in 1884, the same year as Marks & Spencer, which started out as a stall in an open market in Leeds known as Marks' Penny Bazaar.

Covid: Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppers," Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK?Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in WalesWhat are the social distancing rules?Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks.""  Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe.  ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups.  ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers. Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK.  In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond.  ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday that he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week that it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets.  It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary. ",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:33:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55618408
"My spending has gone up, not down, in lockdown'"," There are few benefits from lockdown, but one often touted is that people are managing to save a little money: lower transport costs, fewer shop-bought office lunches, cheaper childcare costs and no foreign holidays. Single mum Caroline Rice gives a wry smile when asked if she's managed to squirrel away extra cash over the past few months during pandemic restrictions. ""My spending is up,"" she says. ""The heating costs are higher because it's very cold. I'm having to shop locally because of lockdown, where the prices are slightly higher. The nearest Asda is 12 miles away."" The small savings on little luxuries that many people are making - fewer coffees or restaurant meals - were never an option for her in the first place.  Her meagre finances meant the registered child minder, who lives in rural County Fermanagh, was already living week-to-week. Now it seems like day-to-day, she says. ""There's a mental stress, fatigue, in having to check the bank balance every day to see how much I'm down,"" she says. ""My child and I haven't bought any clothes in almost a year."" She's having to home-school her child. Many people wouldn't think twice about printing off their child's maths homework project. Caroline had to write it out by hand because they could not afford the ink. And she is not alone. A new report on the finances of low-income families during the pandemic says they are twice as likely to have increased their spending.  It says extra costs for food, energy and remote learning equipment have piled financial pressure on the poor.  The study - Pandemic Pressures - was a collaboration between the Resolution Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities research project at the University of York. Dr Ruth Patrick, a social policy lecturer at the University of York, says talk of saving money during the pandemic is ""worlds away"" from the experiences of many low-income parents and carers. ""Parents have found their spending increases, as some of the usual strategies they use to get by on a low income - shopping around for the best deal, going to families and friends for a meal when the cupboards are empty - have become suddenly impossible,"" she said. For Shirley Widdop, an increase in food costs has been one of the biggest issues. The disabled single parent, who lives in Keighley, now has to shield for health reasons. That means using online deliveries a lot.  She says: ""There's a minimum basket size [with online orders]. You often have to bulk buy in case there's a problem getting delivery slots.""  When not shielding, Shirley would seek out food in her supermarket's reduced-price section. ""There used to be just a couple of people. Now there are crowds,"" she says. ""Not everyone has easy access to the internet. And not everyone has a functioning bus service."" The report notes that the pandemic has been marked by a huge reduction in overall spending, with entertainment and social activities restricted by lockdown. Higher-income households have been the main beneficiaries of this ""enforced saving"", as they spend 40% more of their income on recreation and leisure activities than the poorest fifth of households. The report says that in contrast to this overall picture, the pandemic has in many cases made it more expensive to live on a low income with children. More than one in three (36%) low-income households with children have increased their spending during the pandemic so far, compared with about one in six (18%) who have reduced their spending.  Among high-income households without children, 13% have increased their spending, compared with 40% who have reduced it. The report highlights three main reasons for these extra pressures: Parents with children at home 24 hours a day have seen higher food and energy bills, while the need to entertain them during the lockdowns has brought additional costsHome-schooling has meant extra costs, such as acquiring laptops, paying for internet access and obtaining additional study materialsFamilies' food costs have risen because of fewer in-store promotions, while shielding has meant using more expensive home delivery options or using more expensive local shops closer to home. It should also be noted, the report says, that these extra spending pressures are squeezing living standards that had stagnated even before the pandemic. To ease the burden, the report says the government should be seeking to maintain the Â£20-a-week rise in Universal Credit (UC) into next year. Otherwise, six million households face having their incomes cut by more than Â£1,000.  Mike Brewer, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The pandemic has forced society as a whole to spend less and save more. But these broad spending patterns don't hold true for everyone. ""The extra cost of feeding, schooling and entertaining children 24/7 means that, for many families, lockdowns have made life more expensive to live on a low income."" However, a government spokesperson said measures had been put in place to ""ensure that nobody is left behind"", including extra welfare payments, job protection safeguards, the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme, and equipment for home-schooling. ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond,"" the spokesperson said. Sometimes the overall economic figures can not capture the actual on-the-ground financial reality. The pandemic lockdowns have led to a ""K-shaped"" recovery. Across the entire economy, staying at home has meant less capacity to spend on going out and a surge in savings. But the economic picture is both up and down at the same time, depending on which household.  The average picture is composed of wealthier people saving a huge amount and poorer families more squeezed than ever. This report shows how children staying at home have increased food and energy bills. The cost of buying food has increased with fewer store promotions and a requirement to use more expensive local shops. The furlough scheme has kept people paid, but not necessarily on full pay. So the chancellor hopes that the vaccine rollout could unleash pent up demand in the form of huge levels of savings from the already well-off. And yet at the same time, will continue to face pressure over extending support - for example, the Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit.",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:59:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55618528
Samsung bets on bespoke fridges to lure millennials," Samsung says it plans to offer more bespoke electronics to appeal to younger customers. The South Korean giant saw a big spike in sales of fridges and cleaners during the pandemic while online sales grew 50% globally during the third quarter. One area of growth in South Korea were fridges that can be customised according to size, material and colour. Samsung plans to start selling personalised fridges in the US, Middle East and Europe later this year. Samsung profits soar on work from home demandSamsung sees sales surge from rival Huawei's banHopes of shake-up at Samsung after death of chairman Specialty fridges for kimchi (fermented cabbage) are a popular option and accounted for more than 67% of the South Korean market last year. ""Customers had few options among products made by a traditional manufacturing system,"" said  Jaeseung Lee, Samsung's president and head of digital appliances business.  ""Our way of manufacturing has to be changed for the personalisation of appliances. And that's a big transition."" Samsung, which also offers bespoke wine coolers and dishwashers, wants to include suppliers and furniture studios in its manufacturing process to come up with more design options.  The electronics firm is also putting more software in its appliances such as artificial intelligence (AI). While Samsung has its own Bixby voice assistant, Mr Lee said it is open to working with rivals Amazon and Google to connect their systems to its gadgets. Big electronic companies have benefitted during the pandemic as more people worked from home and relied on gadgets and the internet in their daily lives. Many of these brands will be showcasing their new technology at a digital version of the Consumer Electronics Show this week. The tech event, which is normally staged in the US gaming resort of Las Vegas, kicked off on Monday. Samsung showed off its Bot Handy, a robotic waiter and butler that can pour you wine and do the washing up.

Ford ends decades of Brazil manufacturing," Ford has said it is closing its last three factories in Brazil, putting an end to decades of manufacturing presence in the country. The US carmaker blamed the pandemic, which it said had amplified years of poor sales and ""significant losses"" in the region. About 5,000 people, mostly in Brazil, are expected to lose their jobs. The decision is part of a global restructuring by Ford as it tries to improve its financial performance. ""With more than a century in South America and Brazil, we know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,"" said Ford chief executive Jim Farley. Before the Covid outbreak, Ford had announced plans to scale back in several markets, with closures in countries that included Brazil, the UK, France, Germany and Russia.  It cut hundreds more jobs last year amid a downturn in car sales due to the pandemic. On Monday, Ford said it planned to stop operations at its CamaÃ§ari and TaubatÃ© plants immediately, though some production of parts will continue for a few months to support inventories.   The TaubatÃ© factory, which opened in 1974 near SÃ£o Paulo, made engines, while Camcari, which opened in 2001, produced cars such as the Ka Hatch. The Troller plant in Horizonte, in the north-eastern state of CearÃ¡, which makes off-road vehicles, is due to shut in the fourth quarter of 2021. Ford said it expected the wind-down to cost $4.1bn, including separation payments, and was working to find buyers for the plants. The firm, which opened its first assembly plant in Brazil in 1920, later expanding to full-blown manufacturing, will retain some presence in the country, including a regional headquarters in SÃ£o Paulo. ""I want to emphasize that we are committed to the region for the long term and will continue to offer customers full sales, service and warranty support,"" said Lyle Watters, president of Ford South America and the company's International Markets Group. Research firm IHS Markit estimates that global car sales dropped about 15% in 2020. In Brazil, sales dropped 26% and are not expected to recover for at least two years, Ford said.",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:55:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55626572
UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'," The UK economy will ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned. The chancellor told MPs the new national restrictions were necessary to control the spread of coronavirus.  However, he said they would have a further significant economic impact, ""Even with the significant economic support we've provided, over 800,000 people have lost their job since February,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have not and will not be able to save every job and every business. ""But I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses."" The chancellor said ""the road ahead will be tough"", but maintained that the government was ""taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country"". He said that fiscal stimulus provided so far amounted to more than Â£280bn, while 1.2 million employers had furloughed almost 10 million employees. At the same time, three million people had benefited from self-employment grants. Mr Sunak said he would ""bear in mind"" calls to extend business rate relief and provide further support for the hospitality sector at the Budget in March. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of being ""out of ideas"" and providing ""nothing new"". She said: ""The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know."" The chancellor's words reflect the fact that with a widespread lockdown, the first months of 2021 are likely to see a further contraction in the UK economy and probably an official double-dip recession. This reflects the physical shutdown nationwide of hospitality and retail, as well as the effect in the data of school shutdowns too. In addition, consumers and workers are likely to be more cautious as the vaccine starts to be rolled out. So this is a very odd sort of economic tripwire. The challenge in the next weeks and months gets bigger, although not as big as it was last April. But beyond that, there is the hope of something normal. The implication for the chancellor as he prepares a vital early March Budget, however, is further delay to the measures, such as tax rises, to deal with historic levels of pandemic government borrowing.

Etsy sorry as 'Camp Auschwitz' T-shirt sparks fury," Online marketplace Etsy has apologised after a T-shirt emblazoned with the words Camp Auschwitz was found for sale on its site. The Auschwitz Memorial called the T-shirt ""painful"" and ""disrespectful"" to victims of the death camp and asked for the item to be taken down. Etsy said it had immediately banned the seller on becoming aware of the item. But it faced fury online as it emerged one of the rioters who stormed Congress had worn a Camp Auschwitz top. More than a million people were murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland by the Nazis during World War Two, most of them Jews. The T-shirt, which also featured a skull and crossbones, was posted on Etsy by a US seller and available to buy in the UK for Â£19.95. According to to reports, the listing described the T-shirt as ""everything you've dreamed of and more"" and ""flattering for both men and women"".  The Auschwitz Memorial thanked Etsy for swiftly taking down the listing, but many still reacted angrily on Twitter. One person on Twitter replied to The Auschwitz Memorial: ""It is insane that you have to make this request. Shame on Etsy to allow such a horrendous thing to be offered in your shop - who allowed this? This is unacceptable!"" Some people called for a boycott of Etsy but others urged against this, saying it would only hurt independent sellers who used the platform legitimately.  ""Etsy is like an EBay for handcraft sellers... there are one or two bad apples like this but hundreds of great hand crafters who rely on Etsy for their income,"" one tweeted.  ""Instead of boycotting you can report this listing at the bottom of the page."" On 6 January rioters breached the US Capitol in Washington in a bid to block certification of the US presidential election result. Five people died including a policeman.  The mob - which included members of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys - had been encouraged by President Trump as part of his attempt to overturn his election defeat.  An Etsy spokeswoman said: ""We are deeply saddened by the events that took place at the US Capitol.  ""Etsy's long-standing policies prohibit items that promote hate or violence, and we are vigilantly monitoring our marketplace for any such listings that may have been inspired by recent unrest.  It said: ""We removed this item immediately when it was brought to our attention and have also banned the shop that attempted to list this item. Items that glorify hate or violence have no place on Etsy and we are committed to keeping our marketplace safe.""",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 15:24:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55617924
Covid: 'I’m one of those people who’s been left out'," Small business owner Jon Wilding is facing a dilemma: his livelihood is on hold because of Covid restrictions and he has a big tax bill to settle. If his company supplying marquees to outdoor events goes bust, the taxman will get paid, but his reputation as a businessman will be ruined forever. ""If I shut the business down, I then become director of a business that's gone bankrupt, at which stage getting loans in the future becomes nigh-on impossible,"" he told the BBC. ""I feel like I'm one of those people who's been left out. We don't need a lot to keep going,"" said Mr Wilding, of Cannock in the West Midlands. ""The government say their support system is the best in the world, we've done furlough, this that and whatever, but it's not getting to all the people that need it."" Apart from the Bounce Back Loan scheme, his two-person business has received no government assistance. His colleague was furloughed in March last year, but because Mr Wilding is the director, he is not allowed to furlough himself. Business offered new grants to survive lockdownBusinesses 'crushed' by new England lockdownPM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is particularly concerned about people like Mr Wilding. It says directors of small companies, who pay themselves in dividends rather than drawing a salary, are not receiving any help from the government. The FSB says somewhere between 700,000 and 1.1 million people fall into this category. It has put forward ideas to help some of those firms, which it hopes ministers will adopt. The FSB's proposed Directors Income Support Scheme would pay them grants of up to Â£7,500 to cover three months of lost trading profits. It would be limited to those who earn less than Â£50,000 a year. ""Company directors, the newly self-employed, those in supply chains and those without commercial premises are still being left out in the cold,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Without further government help to cope with the effects of the pandemic, a record 250,000 small businesses could be lost in the next 12 months, the FSB said. ""The development of business support measures has not kept pace with intensifying restrictions,"" Mr Cherry added. ""As a result, we risk losing hundreds of thousands of great, ultimately viable small businesses this year, at huge cost to local communities and individual livelihoods."" The FSB based its prediction on a survey of 1,400 small firms, 5% of which said they expected to close this year. If those figures were replicated across the country, some 250,000 of the UK's 5.9 million small firms could disappear, it said. Mr Cherry said the government had met the latest national lockdown ""with a whimper"" and called for help that went beyond the retail, leisure and hospitality businesses. The FSB said it had submitted its support scheme proposals to the Treasury and was expecting a decision this month. The Treasury said nothing was planned at present, but added: ""Our support schemes are designed to get help to those who need it most whilst protecting the taxpayer from fraud, but of course we keep everything under review and are always open to further ideas.""

Royal Mail: Can new boss Simon Thompson turn it around?," Simon Thompson, a former Ocado executive who also ran the NHS Test and Trace app, has been named as Royal Mail's new UK boss. But he faces a tough job reinvigorating the postal service whose last permanent chief executive, Rico Back, quit unexpectedly in May. Royal Mail has struggled to cope with a surge in parcel deliveries during the pandemic which caused delays over Christmas.  The volume of letters it delivers has also continued to fall as people rely more on email and text. The firm has admitted ""failing to adapt"" to the new reality and ""holding on to outdated working practices and a delivery structure that no longer meets customer needs"". Online shopping surge blamed for Royal Mail delaysRoyal Mail boss in surprise exit after two years The hope is that Mr Thompson, who has held customer-service oriented roles at HSBC and Lastminute.com, can bring the service into the 21st Century as it faces fierce competition from within the parcel delivery market. ""Adapting with flexibility is not Royal Mail's strongest point, and it will need to be much more nimble to keep abreast of its customers changing needs and stay in with a chance of keeping up with the competition,"" said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.  Mr Thompson's appointment comes after a tough year for Royal Mail, which last month agreed a pay deal with the Communication Workers Union (CWU), ending a two-year dispute. For the past eight months the company has been run by interim chief executive Stuart Simpson, who took over when Mr Back stepped down after less than two years in the job. Mr Back had faced criticism over his pay and was reportedly running the business from his home in Switzerland at the time of his departure.  The service's problems are deeper rooted, however, with sales having fallen in every year but one since it was privatised in 2014.  Ms Streeter said it had underinvested in new technology for years, leaving it ""playing catch up"" with the competition, despite its dominant position as the UK's universal postal provider. Its Universal Service Obligation - to provide a postal service to all parts of the UK at flat rates - is another burden not faced by its rivals.  ""With the decline in letter writing accelerating, Royal Mail needs to better capitalise on the online shopping boom, but it struggled desperately over the festive period to keep up with the huge demand on its service,"" said Ms Streeter. ""That is likely to have pushed some of its traditional customers into the arms of its rivals, with the likes of Hermes which uses self-employed couriers, proving a tough competitor in terms of price."" According to Dr Paul Simmonds of Warwick Business School, Mr Thompson's experience working for customer-focused businesses such as Apple, Honda and Ocado will be a ""strength"". He also has some knowledge of Royal Mail having been a non-executive director since 2017. ""Top of his 'in tray' is the need to reinvigorate the group's efforts to transform itself,"" Dr Simmonds said. Part of this will involve striking further agreements with the CWU on pay and conditions so it can bring in more efficient work practices, something that will take skill and diplomacy, he said.   ""Of equal importance is the question of what to do with the letters business which is in terminal decline."" It is not all bad news for the business as its international arm, run by Martin Seidenberg, has been performing well. But on Monday, Royal Mail's interim chairman Keith Williams said the firm was in a period of ""significant transition"" and needed to ""move quickly"" to improve its services. Mr Thompson said it had been a ""challenging year"" for Royal Mail, adding: ""Looking ahead, we need to build on the great trust we have on the doorstep. We need to develop a razor-sharp focus on the customer."" Mr Thompson will be paid about 20% less than Mr Back, with a base salary of Â£525,000 and a pension allowance of 13.6%. He will also be eligible to participate in the firm's short-term and long-term incentive plans, taking his total annual remuneration to around Â£1.4m.  Mr Back took home Â£1.7m last year and received a Â£5.8m payout on joining the firm despite shareholder objections.",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:07:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615471
"Cryptoasset investing? Be prepared to lose the lot, warns watchdog"," The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets. The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.  Many cryptoassets are not covered by investment regulation or protection. The warning is the latest in a string from the FCA and comes as Bitcoin, the best-known crypto currency, hits record highs. Some firms are drumming up new business by promising high returns for the investment. Last week, the price of Bitcoin, which has been in existence for 12 years, soared to over $40,000 - just short of Â£30,000. Its eye-catching swings in price have drawn in scores of investors.  The FCA is concerned that while the highs are attractive, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, and its rivals, mean there is a high risk of losses. It also means they can be difficult to understand and convert back to cash, and, unlike other forms of investment, such products have no associated tangible asset value.  The FCA warns cryptoasset investors they will not have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service as they would if they invested in standard products, such as shares. It said in a statement: ""Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors' money.  ""If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money."" It said consumers should be wary if they're contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true and advises potential investors to visit its ScamSmart pages for more information on how to protect against fraud. At the very least, it says investors should check the firm itself is registered with the FCA for anti money laundering. Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""The regulator is clearly concerned that the high risks already inherent in cryptoassets are being compounded by scam activity, as well as unregulated firms targeting consumers with marketing material that highlights the rewards, but not the potential downside, of investing in cryptoassets. ""Unfortunately Bitcoin and other cryptoassets are subject to dramatic price falls as well as rises. Consumers should be on high alert for unsolicited communications linked to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and should consider any marketing material with an extremely critical eye.""",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:15:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615514
Dr Martens kickstarts plan to join stock market," Footwear brand Dr Martens is considering selling shares in the business to stock market investors. The shoemaker sells 11 million pairs of footwear a year in more than 60 countries, with annual sales of Â£672m.  Its best-known product is the eight-holed 1460, which was initially made as a work boot in Northampton in 1960. Dr Martens' most recent figures show rising sales, despite Covid-related restrictions on its stores, as it shifts more sales direct to consumers. The company runs 130 stores around the world, but its push to online sales mean these now account for about a fifth of its revenues. Group revenues for the six months to September 2020 were Â£318.2m, up 18% on the previous year, despite the impact of the pandemic. It also sells a large proportion of its products through other retailers, but says it wants to continue the expansion of its own retail operations. The company's air-cushioned sole was developed by Munich-based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck and the UK patent rights were sold to R Griggs Group.  The footwear that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. The boots also become popular with punks in the 1970s and had a resurgence when Britpop emerged in the 1990s. The company has been owned by Luxembourg-based IngreLux since 2014, which is linked to private equity giant Permira.

Parler social network sues Amazon for pulling support," Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called ""free speech"" social network. Parler is suing the tech giant, accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it. Parler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter. The platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user. Amazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence. In response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it. ""AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,"" the complaint reads. ""It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter."" Google and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements. However, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content. Parler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host. However, chief executive John Matze told Fox News on Sunday that ""every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too"". ""We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,"" he added. AWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week. Facebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms, citing concerns that he might incite further violence. Parler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory. He had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter. ""Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?"" he tweeted over the weekend. However, Amazon told Parler that it had seen a ""steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms"", adding that it did not believe the platform's administrators had an ""effective process"" that could tackle the problem. Examples it provided include posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists. Parler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another ""free speech"" social network that is popular with far-right commentators. It has claimed to have ""gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing"".  Parler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence. During a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America.  But as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms.  Most seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere.  ""Well this is the end,"" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party.",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:01:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55615214
China brings in new law to fight Trump's sanctions," China is pushing back against a flurry of US sanctions with new rules that protect its firms from ""unjustified"" foreign laws. Changes announced over the weekend allow Chinese courts to punish companies that comply with such restrictions. US President Donald Trump has continued to target Chinese companies he believes are a threat to US national security. Measures include punishing companies that supply parts to blacklisted firms. Trump bans Alipay and seven other Chinese appsNYSE does a U-turn on Chinese telecoms delistingsUS telcos to 'rip and replace' Huawei components On Monday, three large Chinese telecoms firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are expected to see their shares delisted based on alleged ties with its military. The NYSE is removing China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom Hong Kong, based on an executive order signed by Mr Trump in November. The delistings follow a raft of actions against Chinese firms in recent months including TikTok, Huawei and microchip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). Last week, Mr Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps including popular payments platform Alipay, as well as WeChat Pay. The US president claims such tech companies share data with the Chinese government - allegations they have denied. In a statement on Saturday, China's Ministry of Commerce introduced the new rules on ""counteracting unjustified extra-territorial application"" of foreign laws. ""Legal persons that are hurt by the application of foreign legislation can issue legal proceedings in court and claim compensation for the damage done,"" said Bert Hofman, director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore. ""The government can also take other countermeasures."" The measures, which came into effect immediately, do not mention the US directly, although China has long complained  about US sanctions and restrictions on trade.  But legal experts say it is unclear how the new law will be implemented.  ""One point that remains to be clarified is whether the order is intended to target sanctions against China specifically or sanctions targeting a third country, such as Iran or Russia, which has a detrimental impact on Chinese companies,"" Nicholas Turner, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson in Hong Kong, told the BBC. ""Companies with significant business interests in China may need to tread carefully."" Angela Zhang, a Chinese law professor at the University of Hong Kong, added: ""Consider a scenario that a European bank freezes the assets of a Chinese official that was sanctioned by the United States, the Chinese statute will allow the official to sue the European bank to recover his loss."" Mr Turner believes China is also protecting itself against future sanctions that Mr Trump may bring in before he leaves the White House later this month. ""I am expecting more actions to be taken before the 20th [January] based on statements from the US state department, although it remains to be seen whether they can push any new ones out in time, given the situation,"" he added.

UK leading the way in use of language-learning apps," The popularity of language-learning apps has boomed around the world during the coronavirus lockdowns, and the UK has, somewhat surprisingly, led the way. For a country not renowned for its population's skill or enthusiasm at learning a foreign language, the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have seen many more Britons try their hand at becoming at least a bit bilingual. With lockdowns limiting what we can otherwise do with our leisure time, people have been downloading apps to swap their ""hellos"" for a ""buenos dÃ­as"", ""bonjour"" or ""guten tag"". Londoner Chelsey Hames started using language app Duolingo to learn some French last year. After a few months, the 33-year-old says she ""could suddenly read blocks of French text"". ""While I can't translate word for word, I can now get the idea and sentiment behind the writing. It is absolute magic."" US firm Duolingo says that its new user numbers soared in 2020, especially in the UK. It says that globally they were up 67% compared with 2019, while in the UK they shot up by 132%, almost double the worldwide average. ""The UK has really embraced language learning during the pandemic,"" says Duolingo's UK manager Colin Watkins. Prior to Covid-19 he says the biggest reason British users said they wanted to learn a language was for travelling overseas. But with global travel mostly curtailed, people were now learning because of other factors. ""Since Covid there's been a huge increase in people wanting to learn for a whole variety of reasons - whether that is for [helping with] school, brain training or culture. We have all wanted to do something positive with our time."" For the app's now 13 million UK users, Spanish remains the most popular language that people want to learn, followed by French. Other language apps have also seen big growth. London-based Busuu says that while its active global user numbers tripled last year, numbers in the UK rose more than fourfold (312%). It now has more than three million UK users. Meanwhile, Berlin-based Babbel says its UK user registrations increased by 80% in 2020, compared with a 50% rise worldwide. It now has 10 million customers globally, but did not release a figure for the UK. What Babbel did say is that its data shows that Britons are actually much better at learning a foreign language than their reputation suggests. ""When a lot of Brits say that they are not very good at language learning, that's the first thing that we don't see in our data,"" says Babbel's chief executive Arne Schepker. ""[For Britons], both learning engagement and how much you learn - how easy you find it to build a learning habit, the amount of mistakes and the amount of progress that you make through our material - is absolutely competitive in the international environment."" He adds that Spanish is now the most popular language for its UK users, overtaking French. And that the new top reason why people have signed up is an interest in language learning and other cultures, which has overtaken travel. But why are more British people now learning a new language compared with the global averages? Duolingo's Mr Watkins says there may have been a cultural change. ""The UK now sees real value in learning a language for fun, not because they have to,"" he says. ""People are learning because of culture, brain training, family, and relationships, along with school and travel. We want a positive use of our time, and to do something productive on our phones. Covid gave people the stimulus to do this."" Maria Lievano, a Spanish teacher based in the UK, thinks that Brexit may have also played a factor. ""It is possible that Brexit may have played a part in why the UK, in particular, saw so many people using these apps,"" she says. ""Particularly those who want to give themselves the opportunity to work in, or do business with, other countries now Britain has left the EU,"" she says. ""So with many people at home furloughed, or redundant, this period gave them time to evaluate their future career options, whether to look for work abroad or to improve their skill set. ""And for others, perhaps learning a foreign language is simply a way to dream of the holiday they can't go on due to the pandemic."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. While Duolingo and Busuu both offer free and paid-for premium versions, Babbel is only free for the first week. All three have put a lot of work into their software to try to make the learning process as effective as possible. But are they actually any good? How proficient can people get in another language by using them? Renowned linguist Stephen Krashen, professor emeritus of the University of Southern California, is not very complimentary. ""My analyses of their results show that they achieve the same mediocre results as traditional methods do in regular classrooms, and produce the same lack of enthusiasm from students,"" he says. ""We don't acquire language by speaking or writing, even when we get our errors corrected. Rather, the ability to speak and write fluently and accurately is the result of language acquisition via comprehensible input, such as good books, movies and interesting stories."" Busuu's co-founder Bernhard Niesner admits that ""the best way to learn a language is to be in the country, and be fully able to speak with native speakers"" but says that ""we want to replicate that with Busuu"". He adds that he believes the popularity of language-learning apps is here to stay.  ""We think that this is going to sustain because a lot of people now, for the first time, have used their mobile phone to learn something, and they understand the benefit of it,"" he says. ""It's super flexible, it's personalised, it's much cheaper maybe than traditional learning."" French learner Chelsey Hames says: ""There is something about learning and speaking more than one language that I think brings the world a little closer together."" ""And it feels good to be a part of that, particularly in our current situation.""",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:02:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55562267
Supermarket staff: 'We're lucky if people wear masks'," ""People did take the first lockdown a lot more seriously - in this lockdown we're lucky if people are wearing masks."" Skye Henson is 23 and works in a supermarket in Lincoln and has worked throughout the pandemic. She says now is definitely the toughest time to be working as people are no longer respecting rules like social distancing. ""A good 30% of the people that come into our shop don't wear masks and just outright don't think it's an issue,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""They don't consider us to be in any kind of danger, so for me I do think a lot of it is the public putting us at risk."" Stricter Covid supermarket rules considered in Wales Morrisons set to ban shoppers refusing face masksAre lockdown rules changing? and other questions Her words come as the government has warned shoppers to follow the rules in supermarkets.  Skye says she's faced a lot of abuse from the public when trying to enforce mask-wearing too. ""He was coughing so I asked him to put on his mask and he said, 'You can't expect me to wear it, I can't breathe in it' and he was very nasty about it,"" she says. She has a message for people visiting supermarkets. ""Even if you don't think you're personally at risk, there's people who us workers have at home that are. ""I can't see my family throughout this whole thing because they are high risk, so please be considerate of us. ""Also be respectful of us, we're just doing our job and we shouldn't have to face abuse in our workplace - we're not getting paid enough!"" Nearly 300 miles away in Edinburgh, Lucy Scyner has been having a similar experience during her supermarket shifts. ""Social distancing with customers has gone out the window,"" she says. ""During Christmas it was absolutely mental with people coming in and reaching over each other, reaching over you, they're up in your face and you want to be as polite as possible and ask people to step back. ""I personally feel anxious about going in - our store has done everything they can to make us safe but it's when customers are in that you feel unsafe."" The 18-year-old balances her job with college and says people not sticking to the rules makes her life a lot more stressful. ""I was working on Friday and I had a customer come right up in my face who wasn't wearing a mask,"" she says. ""I don't think my job is being appreciated enough - I know that a lot of people in supermarkets are young and people like me and are also students. Our work is being overlooked."" She has a message for people who are planning on visiting their local supermarket. ""Treat it the way we treated it at the start of the pandemic where people were being a lot more careful with what they were doing.  ""People are forgetting how dangerous it actually is. Everybody's scared so if we all work together and we all wear masks and wash our hands we can end it sooner."" Liv works at a supermarket in Ipswich and had a different view on whether people should wear masks when she spoke to Newsbeat back in October. ""I do think masks give people a sense of security and a little bit of extra protection but I wouldn't say it bothers me whether people wear them or not,"" she said. ""I know the government says it's compulsory in some places but on the whole I do think it's a personal choice."" The 28-year-old also thinks people who are exempt get a backlash if they're not wearing them.  ""If you see someone not wearing a mask, just mind your business. As long as you're two metres away from them, I don't see how it affects you."" Liv's supermarket doesn't order people to wear masks because customers could have an underlying health condition they don't want to disclose. The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, says shops are meeting their responsibilities in encouraging mask wearing. It says they're communicating the rules through things like signs, in-store announcements and other reminders. But more general rules across the UK now say face masks are compulsory in shops. Liv's store has brought in a marshal who ""politely"" asks people without masks if they'd like to wear one. She says she feels safe at work and says social distancing rules are being followed. The advice from the World Health Organisation is that masks should be worn in public places. But for Liv, there's not enough evidence they work. ""I've worked through the whole pandemic in a supermarket. At the start we were told we didn't need to wear them, so it's just a bit far-fetched for me now."" Masks became mandatory inside shops in the summer - after the first lockdown. Scotland was the first nation to require masks in shops in early July, followed by England later that month. They became mandatory in Northern Ireland in August and in Wales in September 2020. Iv does have one request though when it comes to mask wearing. ""What annoys me the most is when people are wearing masks but don't wear them properly so it's not over their nose,"" she says. ""You're either going to wear it or you're not going to wear it.""

Greener planes of the future... or just pretty plans?," At an undisclosed location Airbus has spent months testing a radical looking plane. At 10ft (3m) wide, it is only small, but it could be the start of something very big in the aerospace industry. It looks like a flying wedge - known in the trade as a blended-wing design. Airbus calls the remote-controlled aircraft Maveric and is keen to emphasise that, at the moment, it is only exploring how the configuration works. But it says the design has ""great potential"". One day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet. In traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky. Under a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload. Maveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. ""There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,"" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant. ""We believe that we have to go into a reallyâ¦ breakthrough technology,"" she says. An equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Researchers there are working on a design known as the ""Flying-V"". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350. Like Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves. The designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be ""plugged"" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once. ""We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,"" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology. The design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany. The flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success. Researchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as ""Dutch roll"". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as ""a somewhat rough landing"" that damaged the front landing gear. Data from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator. Airlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V. The attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact. But with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as ""showstoppers"".

Among them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency. There's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the ""wing"" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal. Building a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region. ""That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,"" says Mr Wright. Airbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer. Its rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Aircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier. Boeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design. But current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at the 2019 Paris Airshow - are based on proving that concept. For longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power. One major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane. But the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities. Those priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion. Airbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power. In September, Airbus unveiled three concept hydrogen-powered designs. Hydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing. But there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide. In order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution. ""Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,"" he explains.",BBC News - Business,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:06:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51751984
Can onboard rollercoasters save the cruise industry?," It has the worldâs first rollercoaster at sea, a micro-brewery, restaurants from celebrity chefs and sports figures, and, in a sign of the times, a massive medical facility.  The Mardi Gras - Carnivalâs newest and most extravagant ship - also features a water park, a suspended rope course and an atrium built into the side of the ship with moveable panels that open to ocean views.  There are also two theatres and a vintage Fiat car strategically positioned in a âpiazzaâ for selfies.  The cruise liner is expected to start week-long cruises from Florida to the Caribbean and the Bahamas in late April. Of course, that assumes things go as planned.   The launch of the Mardi Gras is a billion dollar bet that the cruise ship industry will rebound after its most bruising year ever. With ships languishing in port and their customers unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions, cruise companies have been bleeding cash.  So will new gimmicks be enough to woo a public still nervous about the risk of catching Covid while they're on holiday? Carnival, for one, is optimistic that many of the nearly 30 million cruise-lovers who boarded a ship in 2019 will be willing to sail again this year.  The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes homeCarnival Cruise boss banks on safety measuresHow the UK's ghost cruise ships became a summer hit âOur internal data suggests, on average, a repeat cruise guest returns every two-plus years, so we have a backlog of past guests ready and waiting to cruise again as we look to begin a phased-in resumption of service in 2021,â Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen told the BBC. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) banned cruises between March and the end of October last year, with the industry voluntarily suspending operations shortly before the ban came into effect. Elsewhere, cruising activity has also been very limited.    The CDC has now lifted the ban - replacing it with a âphasedâ return to passenger operations - but in practice the major cruise lines donât yet know when they will be able to sail again. They do not expect it will be before the second quarter of 2021.  Without passengers, the cruise lines have been losing money. Royal Caribbean, for example, posted a $1.3bn (Â£950m) loss for the third quarter of 2020. Carnivalâs most recent results show an $8bn loss for the first three quarters of 2020. That compares with a profit of about $2.6bn over the same period in 2019. Between mid-March and September of last year, it is estimated that the suspension of cruise operations resulted in a loss of more than 518,000 jobs and $23bn in wages globally, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). Several of the larger operators have teetered on the brink of bankruptcy before seeking out additional capital to stay afloat. As many as half a dozen smaller operators, including the UK-based CMV-Cruise And Maritime Voyages, have gone bust.   Itâs against this backdrop that Carnival is launching the Mardi Gras, a ship worth an estimated $1bn that can accommodate up to 5,280 guests (although under Covid-19 restrictions, its first voyage might not be full).  In a way, it's yesterday's bright idea. The ship took years to build, and when Carnival first ordered it, they almost certainly didn't expect to launch it during a period of economic turmoil.    âWe have to remember that even one year ago, in January 2020, cruises had a great, bright future. The Mardi Gras foundation and the design would have been done maybe five years ago, when cruises couldnât get enough cabins,â said Peter Lynch, an industry analyst and the editor-in-chief of Cruise Passenger magazine.  In better times, he said, cruise companies were more worried about getting âunique selling points onto ships to convince a public who were demanding an ever-increasing number of toysâ.  Carnival isnât the only cruise line to launch a ship this year. In fact, the CLIA says 19 new cruise liners will make their maiden voyage in 2021. A similar number launched in 2019.  But itâs the older ships that might be more revealing. Mr Lynch says the major cruise lines are retiring more ships than they are launching, suggesting a shrinking industry. He estimates the major cruise lines will launch 36,400 new cabins in 2021, but retire 52,500 others.    Florida-based Ken Caine, who runs an online marketplace for used cruise ships, says business is brisk. He thinks it's a sign that the industry is adapting, and positioning itself for a stronger future.  In some cases, the ships he sells are not being used as cruise liners, but as floating hotels. But many of the larger cruise lines are selling off older ships, and the smaller operators are buying in anticipation of better times ahead.  ""People understand that it's not forever,"" he said. The success of new ships like the Mardi Gras will depend on the willingness of passengers to go on cruises again. Cruise lines will have to win over customers after a year when cruises drew attention for all the wrong reasons.  For example, the Diamond Princess, which docked in Japan with Covid-19 cases in February, was at one point the worldâs biggest cluster outside China. And the Ruby Princess was linked to the spread of Covid-19 in Australia, after 2,650 passengers were allowed to disembark when the ship docked in Sydney in March. Customers are expecting cruise lines to change, according to Mr Lynch. Whereas previously, a customerâs top priority was getting a good deal, now they appear to want more security.    âWhatâs really important is the change in motivation. Once upon a time I could rely on the fact that deals were number one. Today, deals are number three or even number four. And, health protocols and flexibility of booking are numbers one and two,â he said.   But cruise passengers are often repeat customers and many canât wait to get out to sea once more. In fact, many customers delayed rather than cancelled their trips. Mr Lynch said 55% of his readers have a future cruise credit. Carnival is banking on long-time cruise ship aficionados for a swift rebound.  ""Because our industry is not reliant on business travel, we believe we will disproportionately benefit from the pent-up demand for vacation experiences as compared with many others in the travel sector,"" Mr Gulliksen said.

Elon Musk's six secrets to business success," Elon Musk has just become the richest person in the world, overtaking Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.  The Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur's net worth has crossed $185bn (Â£136bn) after an increase in the share price of the electric car company. So, what is the secret of his success? A few years back I spent almost an hour discussing exactly this with him. To mark his new milestone we decided to dust the interview off and share it with you. So here is Elon Musk's guide to success in business.  This is absolutely central to Elon Musk's attitude to business.   When I interviewed him in 2014 he said he didn't know how rich he was.   ""It's not as if there is a pile of cash somewhere,"" he said. ""It's really just that I have a certain number of votes in Tesla, and SpaceX, and SolarCity, and the marketplace has value on those votes.""   He doesn't have anything against the pursuit of wealth ""if it's done in sort of an ethical and good manner"", but said it just isn't what drives him.  The approach certainly seems to be working.   The real-life inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark of Iron Man fame was worth perhaps $10bn when we spoke in 2014.  His electric car company, Tesla, has performed particularly well. Shares have surged over the past year to take its value to more than $700bn. For that you could buy Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, and still have enough left over to buy Ferrari. But Musk, who turns 50 this year, doesn't expect to die rich. He said he thinks most of his money will be spent building a base on Mars, and wouldn't be surprised if the project consumed his entire fortune. In fact, like Bill Gates, he would probably regard ending his life with billions in the bank as a mark of failure because he hadn't put that money to good use. That Mars base is a clue to what Elon Musk believes is the key to success.   ""You want things in the future to be better,"" he told me. ""You want these new exciting things that make life better."" Take SpaceX. He told me he set the company up because he was frustrated the US space programme wasn't more ambitious.   ""I kept expecting us to advance beyond Earth, and to put a person on Mars, and have a base on the moon, and have, you know, very frequent flights to orbit,"" he said. When that didn't happen, he came up with the idea for the ""Mars Oasis Mission"", which aimed to send a small greenhouse to the red planet. The idea was to get people excited about space again, and persuade the US government to increase Nasa's budget. It was while he was trying to get that off the ground he realised the problem wasn't ""a lack of will, but rather a lack of way"" - space technology was far more expensive than it needed to be. Et voila! The world's cheapest rocket-launching business was born. And here's the important thing, its genesis wasn't about making money, but landing a person on Mars.   Musk told me he regards himself as an engineer rather than an investor, and says what gets him up in the morning is the desire to solve technical problems.   It is that, rather than dollars in the bank, that is his yardstick of progress. He knows every hurdle his businesses overcome helps everyone else who's trying to solve the same problem - and it does it forever. That's why, shortly before we met, the entrepreneur had announced he was going to open up all Tesla's patents to speed up the development of electric vehicles worldwide.   How Elon Musk plans to revolutionise battery technologyElon Musk's vision for autonomous vehicles One of the really striking things about Elon Musk's businesses is how audacious they are.   He wants to revolutionise the car industry, colonise Mars, build super-fast trains in vacuum tunnels, integrate AI into human brains and upend the solar power and battery industries.   There's a common thread here. All of his projects are the kind of futuristic fantasies you'd find in a kid's magazine in the early 1980s.   Put it like this, his tunnelling business is called The Boring Company. Musk makes no secret of the fact he was inspired by the books and movies he consumed as a kid in South Africa. Which brings us to Musk's third business tip - don't hold back. He believes low ambition is baked into most companies' incentive structures. Too many companies are ""incrementalist"", he said. ""If you're the CEO of a big company and you aim for something that's a modest improvement, and it takes longer than expected, and doesn't work out quite as well, then nobody's gonna blame you,"" he told me. You can say it wasn't my fault, it was the suppliers.  If you are bold, and go for a really breakthrough improvement, and it doesn't work, you're definitely going to get fired, he argues. He says this is why most companies focus on making small improvements to their existing products rather than daring to imagine completely new ones.   So, his advice is to make sure you are working on what he calls ""stuff that's going to matter"".   Two things stand out in Musk's personal hierarchy of stuff that matters. First, he wants to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels.   Here's what the entrepreneur had to say about that: ""We're drawing upon deep gas fields and deep oil fields that haven't seen the light of day since the Cambrian era. If the last time something saw light was when the most complex organism was a sponge, you really have to question whether that is a wise move."" Second, he wants to ensure the long-term survival of humanity by colonising Mars and ""making life multiplanetary"". Like I say, think big. This one is obvious. You've got to have skin in the game to do well, but Elon Musk has taken more risks than most. By 2002 he had sold off his holdings in his first two ventures, an internet city guide called Zip2 and the online payment company PayPal. He had just entered his 30s and had almost $200m in the bank.  He says his plan was to put half his fortune into the businesses and keep the other half.  Things didn't work out like that. When I met him, he was just emerging from the darkest period of his business life.  His new companies faced all sorts of teething troubles. SpaceX's first three launches had failed, and Tesla had all manner of production problems, and supply chain, and design issues.   Then the financial crisis struck. Musk said he faced a stark choice. ""I could either keep the money, then the companies are definitely going to die, or invest what I have left and maybe there is a chance."" He kept pouring in money. At one point he was so in debt he had to borrow money from friends just to pay his living expenses, he told me.   So, did the prospect of bankruptcy frighten him?   He says it didn't: ""My kids might have to go to a sort of government school. I mean big deal, I went to a government school."" What really shocked him - and it was clear in 2014 he was still very upset by it - was the delight many pundits and commentators took in his travails.   ""The liberal schadenfreude was really quite astonishing,"" said Musk. ""There were multiple blog sites maintaining a Tesla death watch."" I suggested people may have wanted him to fail because there's a kind of arrogance about his ambition. He rejected that. ""I think it would be arrogant if we said we were definitely going to do it, as opposed to we're aspiring to do it, and we're going to give it our best shot."" This brings us to Musk's next lesson in business success - don't listen to the critics. He told me he didn't believe SpaceX or Tesla would ever make money when he set them up - and the truth is nor did anyone else. But he ignored the doomsters and went ahead anyway.  Why? Remember, this is a man who judges success on the basis of the important problems he's solved, not how much money he has made. Think how liberating that is. He isn't worried about looking stupid because his big financial bet hasn't paid off, what he cares about is pursuing important ideas.  It makes decision making much simpler because he can stay focused on what he believes really matters.  And the market seems to like what he's doing.   In October, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley valued SpaceX at $100bn.   The company has transformed the economics of space flight, but what will make Musk most proud will be how his company has reinvigorated the US space programme.  Last year his Crew Dragon rockets launched six astronauts to the International Space Station, the first such missions from US soil since the space shuttles were retired in 2011. Follow this guide and, with a bit of luck, you'll become impossibly rich and famous too. Then you can start to come out of your shell. Elon Musk is famously a workaholic - he boasts of working 120-hour weeks to keep production of the Tesla Model 3 on track - but since we met he seems to have been enjoying himself. He has stoked controversy with defamation lawsuits, on-air dope smoking and wild outbursts on social media.   In 2018 he ran into trouble with the US financial regulator when he tweeted that he was planning to take Tesla private, and when the Covid-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shut down production at its San Francisco Bay Area factory, he became a vocal opponent of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.   He called panic over the virus ""dumb"" on Twitter, and described stay-at-home orders as ""forcible imprisonment"", saying they were ""fascist"" and a breach of constitutional rights.   In the summer he announced plans to sell off his physical possessions saying they ""weigh you down"".   Days later he took to Twitter to tell the world his newborn son would be called X Ã A-12 Musk. Yet his unpredictable behaviour doesn't seem to have affected his businesses, and the entrepreneur remains as ambitious as ever. In September, Musk claimed Tesla would have a ""compelling"" $25,000 car within three years, and said soon all the company's new cars would be completely self-driving. And his year ended with a real bang in December, when SpaceX tested its Starship launch vehicle, which it hopes will take the first humans to Mars.   The giant rocket exploded when it crash landed six minutes after lift-off.   Elon Musk hailed the test as an ""awesome"" success.

"New York is not dead, but it is on life support'"," Andrea Wilhelm gave up her New York City apartment in August - and she's not sure whether she will ever return.  The 30-year-old software designer loved living in New York - attending Broadway shows, frequenting dog parks, and the serendipitous walks of daily life. For nearly five years, she willingly paid the city's premium rents and taxes, while commuting to work in another state. But the pandemic wore her down. ""I was like, 'The city's going to come back. By July, it's going to be ok.' But it just kept not being ok,"" she says. ""I wasn't planning on leaving at all,"" she adds. ""It was a complete switch."" Since March, property firms and moving companies have reported a rush of demand from people leaving New York, many of them young families, as the pandemic drives demand for bigger homes and more outdoor space, while making relocation easier by expanding remote work. And so far, the surge hasn't shown signs of slowing, says Liz Nunan, president of property firm Houlihan Lawrence, which handles home sales in suburbs around New York City, and reported its best year on record in 2020. ""One of the things I learned in 2020 is that I have no idea what the future holds, but I feel rather bullish on 2021,"" she says. ""I believe we'll have a year that's nearly as strong as 2020 turned out to be."" Last year, longer distance relocations from New York City helped push New York the state to the biggest population decline of any in the US, putting it on track for its first population fall of any decade since the 1970s.  The signs of outflow have spawned a small universe of articles debating whether New York City is dead or dying, and what - if anything - should be done to help it recover.  And as the US confronts an economic crisis likely to outlast the pandemic that precipitated it, such concerns are not unique to the US's largest city. Smaller downtowns across the country have watched in despair as signs of long-sought revival - new restaurants, businesses in formerly abandoned buildings - disappear almost overnight. ""This is a difficult time for everybody,"" says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution think tank. ""The real issue is: can these cities hold their economic vitality?""  In New York, the pandemic has closed theatres, emptied offices, halted tourism, and turned shopping and dining into hazards to be undertaken at your own risk, gutting industries that employed a fifth of the city's workforce. As many as a third of the city's small businesses may not survive the pandemic, according to estimates by local business group, the Partnership for New York City. Most companies in the city's downtown do not expect staff to ever return to the office in full force. Some firms have already left. The situation has driven the city's jobless rate to more than 12% - almost double the national average - swollen the ranks of the homeless, and helped spur the departure of more than 300,000 people like Andrea, further straining public finances. In response, New York leaders have raised the prospect of increasing taxes and cutting services like transportation, garbage collection and park maintenance, while begging for emergency aid from Washington to resolve financial woes - pleas that so far have fallen on deaf ears. Michael Hendrix, director of state and local policy at the free market Manhattan Institute think tank, worries the potential cuts will further accelerate the outflow, hurting the very amenities that make city life attractive and leaving a poorer city for those who remain. ""It's not really so much the pandemic that is the greatest challenge to New York City,"" he says. ""It's really the second order consequences that have dealt a blow to the city's recovery and its citizens. Why cities are not as bad for you as you thinkLockdown city living 'wasn't the best idea'Covid-19 shakes up worldâs most expensive city list ""New York is not dead, but it is on life support,"" he says. ""Whether its recovery is measured in months or years or decades is primarily determined by the degree of leadership that we see in the city. And I think that's why we should be so concerned."" In some ways, such worries are uniquely American, reflecting the safety woes and weak educational systems that set so many US cities apart from counterparts in Europe and Canada, says Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto. He predicts that coronavirus outflow from cities outside the US will be less dramatic and more temporary. In the US, however, the urban revival of the early 2000s had shown signs of fading even before the pandemic, as immigration waned and moves to the suburbs accelerated.  In New York, the population has been falling since 2016. The expansion of remote work caused by the pandemic means the city is now competing with even more places for businesses and families - trends that are unlikely to fully reverse even after life returns to normal, Prof Florida says. ""Talented people have choice now with remote work. Those choices will be made carefully,"" he says. ""The big winners are places with a lot of amenity, and the premium for amenity will grow. That means cities with wonderful coast lines or rural areas near mountains. Places like Miami Beach, or Bozeman, Montana, or Aspen, Colorado, or the Hudson Valley of New York.""  Andrea, who initially decamped to her mother's home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says she hasn't entirely written off New York. But for now, she's planning a cross-country road trip, working remotely while scoping out new cities to potentially call home.   ""I'm going to hop in the carâ¦ and drive around the country, and see if anything feels like a fit,"" she says. ""If it doesn't, then I'll see where the world is in September."" Kevin Pearsall and his wife left New York City in March for Atlanta, Georgia. After years of focusing on their careers in advertising, the 35-year-old says they wanted a hometown where they didn't feel like housing and other living costs remained a stretch - even on their healthy six-figure salaries. They both landed jobs as remote workers for New York firms - another sign that convinced them the city was no longer the only place they could combine professional opportunity and social life. ""All of the great things about New York - speakeasies, beer gardens... that's not really as unique as it used to be,"" he says. ""We were already in motion, thinking about leaving,"" he says. The pandemic ""just accelerated"" the move. New York leaders have expressed confidence that the city will remain a draw, noting that outflow of a few hundred thousand hardly makes a dent in a city of more than eight million.  ""I'm not going to beg people to stay,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said last year. ""I know this city will rebound. I know it. And I know others will come. They have for generations.""  ""We can't overrate this moment in history,"" he added. ""It is a passing moment. There will be a vaccine. And then all the strengths of New York City will reassert again."" How it will shake out in the long term remains a question. The neighbourhoods that emptied during lockdowns last year were the city's wealthiest, but a Manhattan Institute survey this summer found that two in five New Yorkers would leave the city if they could live anywhere they wanted, with dissatisfaction highest among those with lower incomes. Mr Hendrix says it is tempting to hope a more affordable city will emerge if the rich depart, but he worries such an exodus will generate still more challenges, given how dependent the city is on high earners for tax revenue. ""It doesn't take a majority leaving the city or a majority changing their lifestyle to make a big difference,"" he says. New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Prof Florida says the biggest cities, like New York and San Francisco, are likely to remain a draw for young people, who should benefit if rents continue to fall.  But he warns that such declines were short-lived after previous crises. And elsewhere in America, he expects downtown business districts - even some of those in the growing ""Sunbelt"" region - to face major challenges. ""The central business districts - those places which packed and stacked knowledge workers in the vertical towers - they are in for a real reckoning,"" he says.

Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industry," ""I think the impact would be huge,"" says Ahsan Bhatti, owner of online pharmacy Quick Meds. He is concerned about the prospect of online giant Amazon moving into the pharmacy business in the UK. ""I'm worried. They'll have a massive marketing budget, and they'll definitely take a sizeable chunk out of every other pharmacy on the market. There will be closures as a direct result of it,"" he says. Mr Bhatti will be closely watching developments in the US where Amazon Pharmacy launched in November. The service allows customers to make pharmacy transactions through Amazon and receive unlimited, free, two-day deliveries if they have a Prime membership. Investors have taken note, with pharmacy chains like Walgreens and CVS seeing their share prices fall.  Although Amazon hasn't yet announced plans for other countries, chemists in the UK are preparing themselves for a new competitor.  Mr Bhatti is one of a growing number of pharmacists to sell products online, but Amazon's entry would be likely to affect High Street pharmacies as well. ""What is lacking in every other pharmacy across the UK is the logistics and Amazon do that exceptionally well. It's exactly what consumers want - having a prescription by 10am and dispensed by Amazon to them in the evening. The likes of Lloyds Pharmacy and Boots can't do that, and independent pharmacies can only do this on a local level,"" says Mr Bhatti. The UK has a very different pharmacy market from the US, where drug makers can set their own prices. In the UK, drug prices are regulated, so Amazon would not be able to compete with pharmacies on price, but rather on convenience and speed. Mr Bhatti opened Quick Meds in March, after putting in an application to the NHS 11 months earlier. It offers products online, as well as consultations over phone, WhatsApp, email, live chat and video, and even offers same day services locally. However, for nationwide orders, the company relies on Royal Mail - and this is where Mr Bhatti believes Amazon has the edge over online pharmacies as it has proven it can be relied upon for speedy deliveries.  ""As great as Royal Mail are, occasionally things go wrong or missing and these delays might not be a big deal for online shopping but if we're talking about a heart or diabetes medication, all of a sudden, it's a problem,"" he says.  It's not just logistics that Amazon has on its side - the sheer size of the company enables it to have an advantage at the negotiating table. ""In the US, companies like CVS and Walmart negotiate drug prices all the time, and they have a fairly significant amount of market power. They've been able to create monopolies on certain drugs, making it more difficult for consumers to access drugs if you're not shopping with them. If Amazon enters, it disrupts this because they have much more sizeable purchase power,"" says Kate McCarthy, healthcare analyst at research company Gartner. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, once said ""your margin is my opportunity"", implying that Amazon delivered better prices by removing the costs added by the middlemen in the supply chain. The pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors have complex and inefficient supply chains that he would look to cut out.  This ultimately means that Amazon may negotiate better prices, and potentially offer discounted rates to consumers to get them through the online door of Amazon Pharmacy.  According to Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern, serial entrepreneur and author of Post Corona: From Crisis to Opportunity, consumers will be the winners over the short and medium term.  ""For the most part of Amazon's history, as a consumer you're getting products for near cost or sometimes even below cost and that has just been an incredible boon for consumers and shareholders,"" he says.   More Technology of Business Tech trends in 2021: Fast planes and homeworkingCreating animal food from a greenhouse gasA palm oil alternative could help save rainforestsSo you want a career in computer games tournaments?Why Covid may mean more facial recognition tech Amazon Pharmacy is not just about the technology company entering the pharmaceutical retail market; it has been readying itself for the entire healthcare sector. ""Amazon have been working on ways to ensure their platform is dynamic and secure for healthcare organisations in order to partner with them - you see many organisations looking at things like Alexa for healthcare skills, and building healthcare apps on Amazon Web Services, or leveraging Amazon's cloud storage. Now, Amazon is focusing on the actual consumer services,"" says Ms McCarthy.  Eventually, the company could use data from its different arms to build a picture of each consumer's health, and use this to provide them with products and services. ""With their new wearable Amazon Halo, the company can build a 3D image of their consumers and they can then combine this with the foods you eat through Whole Foods, data from Amazon Prime and Alexa, and information such as your post code, relationship status, demographic data,"" says Mr Galloway.  Currently, the healthcare system is largely reactive - consumers seek medication and other healthcare services when they need them but Mr Galloway believes that Amazon could change this dynamic and even offer Prime members special recommendations around exercise products, nutrition and medicines.  ""They can use this to offer proactive healthcare services,"" he says. It wouldn't be unfeasible for Amazon to enter the health insurance market considering the amount of data - and technological capabilities - at its disposal to assess risk.  Mr Galloway says that over the medium to long term, Amazon will put a number of healthcare companies out of business. At the same time, healthcare start-ups may struggle to get a foothold in a market that Amazon has entered.   ""It's very difficult to get funding now for an e-commerce company because the general assumption is that Amazon is unassailable,"" he says.  Amazon counters that, saying it has plenty of competition: ""Amazon Pharmacy operates in a competitive environment with other US pharmacies, and we know our customers have a choice. We are working hard to earn their business,"" a company spokesperson told the BBC. Ms McCarthy says that Amazon typically brings improvement to the industries it enters but says it doesn't typically unseat industry incumbents, and she says the same will be true for healthcare companies. ""It's more a case of how everyone adapts,"" she says.  Mr Bhatti suggests that pharmacies should adapt by going online and diversifying their income. ""You can't rely on NHS income, you have to start developing private services and require that personal touch through face-to-face interactions,"" he says, adding that they should also be prepared to partner with Amazon. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies (AIMp), claims pharmacies are ""not trying to maximise potential sales"" and are instead focusing on ""caring for the health of their patients"".  ""The pharmacy network is already under threat due to the lack of funding and a multi-national player such as Amazon could be the final blow for many and disrupt this valued network. When the choice, and that personal interaction and care in the community is gone, the consumers are not the winners,"" she says.  But Amazon is taking its foray into healthcare seriously - it's not just expanding its already vast retail network. According to Ms McCarthy, Amazon has put out job posts for clinicians both for Amazon Pharmacy and for other areas of its business.  This suggests that it may eventually be able to offer this same personalised service as existing pharmacies.",BBC News - Business,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 01:05:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55228999
CEO Secrets: 'Try bartering to kickstart your business'," Walk down London's Oxford Street and Regent Street and you will see big advertising screens in the windows of many shops, flashing out advertisements. The firm responsible for installing a lot of these screens, and designing the ads on them, is called inurface - a multi-million pound company. ""They're electronic posters,"" says chief executive Josh Bunce. ""But they can display a range of advertisements and messages in the same space."" The deals that inurface has landed with retail giants like Boots and The Body Shop has made it one of the leading lights in the UK's advertising industry.  It's a long way from the firm's beginnings in 2008 in Bristol.  To hit the big time in the capital, Josh knew he had to look like a prestigious advertising company to impress potential clients - and that meant having offices in the heart of London's West End. The problem was affording the rent. For that, he resorted to barter.  ""We wanted to be in the heart of the retail land, which is obviously Regent Street, around Oxford Street,"" says Josh. ""We didn't really have the budget at the time to afford the kind of office that we wanted and the space we wanted to bring our clients into, so we bartered with the landlord."" 'I had zero plans beyond my parents' kitchen''Promoting interns helped save my firm'Dating coach reveals dilemma when starting out'Ask your investors for a yes or no' Josh worked out a deal with a central London office rental company. He offered to install video screens for free throughout their office space. In return, they agreed to let his company off paying six months' rent. ""What we managed to do was negotiate. Basically, putting AV equipment into their office space, from large touchscreens in the meeting rooms to video walls in the reception to enhance the whole space."" Taking that office space in one of London's most prestigious areas worked its magic. The company, which had started life installing video screens in coffee shops in the West Country, suddenly looked like a major player in the industry.  Inurface now turns over Â£32m a year, and other big name clients include Sports Direct, Chelsea football club and Delta Airlines. ""It was a bit of smoke and mirrors, this way of getting a prestigious office address,"" says Josh. ""But in advertising, it's essential to look the part. And we wouldn't have been able to do it without making a barter deal with the landlord."" He recommends that other start-ups also try bartering their services with landlords or business suppliers if they are strapped for cash. ""Bartering goes back to the Stone Age, before money was invented,"" he says. ""But there's no reason you shouldn't try it today. If you're a stationery company, you could have done a similar deal. If you were a telecoms company, you could have done a similar deal."" Many companies have sprung up that specialise in brokering such barter deals amongst companies and Josh is striking a deal with one of them to exchange his services with other business partners. ""It's always worth asking your landlord or suppliers if they will barter products or services,"" says Josh. ""They can only say no, so why not try it? That would be my advice.""

New York transit workers: 'We don't get respect', New Yorkâs Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is essential to keeping the city moving. But workers say throughout the pandemic they havenât been given the care or respect of other frontline workers. A New York City subway conductor and a bus driver share their stories with BBC News.

Covid exercise: 'I'll never go back to the gym again'," January is normally a boom time for gyms, as many of us strive to get healthy for a new year's resolution.  But coronavirus restrictions mean that gyms in the UK are currently closed. At the same time, an explosion in fitness tech means that some people are experiencing incredible transformations from their own home, or their local park, or on the streets near their house. What does this mean for the future of the gym sector? Ben Barbanel lost three stone (19kg) during England's first lockdown last year, when exercise was one of the few reasons to leave the house. The former gym-goer would obsessively track his steps using a Garmin watch, racking up as many as 45,000 a day - not far off a marathon. Ben, who works in finance in London, had put on weight after recovering from major surgery for a bowel condition. But the shift to homeworking meant he could take meetings while out for a walk. ""It fitted in with my lifestyle - I hated the gym and being bullied by a personal trainer,"" he says. ""I thought some clients might have a problem if I was on Zoom, and they saw me not behind a desk, but they all thought it was amazing [that I was out exercising], and that spurred me on."" He's one of many who say they will never set foot in a conventional gym again. Instead, they are hooked on the technology that kept them fit in lockdown, whether that's ""wearable tech"" like fitness trackers and smartwatches, or livestreamed exercise classes. Vicky Malmsjo from Essex downloaded an app called Her Spirit, which offers a supportive community to help women get active. Despite ""hating technology"", the swimming coach, who at one point was in the gym seven days a week, finds the app simple to use. She combines it with a fitness tracker so she can monitor her improvements. ""I'm quite a competitive person, so even though I was being only competitive with myself each week, I tried to increase what I was doing. I ended up walking 10 to 15km (six to nine miles) a day,"" says Vicky. ""I started to post on the app every day, and other people encouraged me. If it hadn't been for those ladies at Her Spirit I don't think I would have done it. Through the whole of lockdown they offered different challenges and things to keep your mind busy."" Both Ben and Vicky have been using relatively inexpensive technology to keep themselves motivated.  But for others, the time and money saved last year - from not going to gyms, not commuting, cancelled holidays, and shut bars and restaurants - has prompted a splurge on expensive internet-connected fitness equipment that enables them to livestream exercise classes and compete with others around the world. One of the most well-known of these digital platforms is Peloton, which makes interactive exercise bikes. Its annual revenues hit $1.8bn (Â£1.3bn) in the 12 months to the end of June 2020, double that of the year before. User numbers rose by the same amount to 3.1 million. Sarah Muse bought herself a Peloton bike after graduating and moving back in with her parents near Washington DC. ""I'm competing against my family members, staying active, and just riding out this pandemic until I can move out of my parents' house,"" she says.  ""Though initially expensive, after I graduated during this pandemic mess, I saved up for a post-graduation trip that never happened. Maybe now my Peloton will get me fit for a future trip I can take!  ""My mindset has definitely improved from increased exercise, and I'm happy to see it is positively changing my extended family's lives.  ""I am truly not interested in a gym membership, but hopefully, I can join a yoga studio when the world returns to somewhat normal, and it is safer in the US."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. But all this change might not necessarily mean a bleak future for the gym industry.  In October, a UK petition to prevent gyms closing received more than 600,000 signatures, while ""When will gyms reopen?"" was one of the most popular UK search trends of 2020. Humphrey Cobbold is the head of UK chain PureGym, where active memberships in December were at 76% of the same time a year earlier. He says gyms have worked hard to make themselves Covid-secure, and have offered a boost to physical and mental wellbeing during the pandemic. ""Not everyone can afford an exercise bike at home or has a large house or garden,"" he says. ""Many people live in small flats, and in shared accommodation, so gyms are the only place they can satisfactorily work out, especially in the cold and dark winter months."" Mintel leisure analyst Lauren Ryan thinks gyms will be able to grow again, if they can keep up with what consumers want. She says they should consider a hybrid model, and also run paid-for internet classes. ""It would be foolish to think that gyms can just go on the way they were before and not expect a loss of interest,"" she says.  ""They need to start thinking about their brands as not just location-based, but as wellbeing focused, that have locations but can deliver to the comfort of your own home or outdoors. And have something that differentiates them from digital fitness products. I think that's where we will see a lot of innovation."" London-based social media consultant Lisa Williams has been impressed by the way her gym, Frame, adapted. ""I had children to look after and work to do, but they offered short online classes in pandemic conditions, things you could do in a flat that were quiet so not to annoy your neighbours.  ""They offered classes without equipment, or I could do mine on my kids' trampoline. Their trainers are silly and fun and high energy, which was exactly what you need in the doom and gloom of the pandemic."" However, she is unlikely to ever return to the gym in person. ""I'm definitely not going back to the gym. I'm a busy working mum, and there is always a reason not to exercise. Online workouts are really good for me because I'm time poor.""",BBC News - Business,"Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:07:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55210452
Covid: Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid?," The furlough scheme has helped pay the wages of millions of people who can't work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The scheme pays employees placed on leave up to 80% of their salary, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. It is often used to support people whose jobs aren't feasible during coronavirus, but can also be used to support parents who have to look after children or those with other caring responsibilities. Schools have closed to most pupils in England, Scotland and Wales - while Northern Ireland will have an ""extended period of remote learning"". Employees are eligible for furlough if they cannot work ""due to caring responsibilities resulting from coronavirus"". This includes childcare,  the government says. However, employers are not obliged to furlough you. Trade union umbrella body TUC says many businesses are not aware of this rule. It says employers should ""do the right thing and furlough mums and dads"". When the furlough scheme was last extended, in November, it was at very short notice. This led to complaints that employers had been forced to lay off people they might have been able to keep. If 100 or more people are being made redundant, for example, group meetings must start at least 45 days before anyone's job ends. Letting employers know months in advance that furlough will be extended until the end of April could affect the business decisions they take for 2021. ""We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable businesses to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said. As coronavirus infections rise again, hospitality and entertainment venues have had to close in many parts of the UK during the run-up to Christmas.  This has increased the pressure for one of the hardest-hit sectors of the economy, where a significant proportion of staff are already on furlough. What help are self-employed getting from government? The scheme pays some of the wages of people who can't do their jobs because their workplace is closed, or there is no longer enough work for them. They may also be unable to work because they are clinically extremely vulnerable and cannot work safely, or they have caring responsibilities due to coronavirus, such as looking after children. You can be furloughed whether you are on a full-time, part-time, agency, flexible or zero-hour contract, but you must have been on your employer's payroll before the extension was announced. It is not necessary to have been furloughed before and you keep all your working rights, including annual and parental leave. While you are on furlough you can take on other jobs, as long as you doesn't break the rules of your contract. You can also take part in training, or volunteer for an unconnected organisation. Since July, employers have been able to bring back workers part-time, and furlough them for the rest. This will continue, and employers will have to pay employees' wages for the hours they work as normal. While employees won't notice any difference in their pay packets, the scheme has become more generous for employers, who will pay less towards it.  Earlier in the year firms had to top up furloughed wages by 20%, with the government paying 60%. The state now puts in the full 80%, with the employer only covering pension and National Insurance contributions. Employers may top up pay with the extra 20% if they want. The scheme still applies throughout the UK. About 10 million jobs have already been claimed for, at a cost of Â£43bn, by the middle of November.

"Covid: UK at 'worst point' of pandemic, says Hancock"," The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlier published its plan to immunise tens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts.  ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules?Inside a mass vaccination centrePM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.  But today he took the unusual step of doing just that.  Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay.  Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity.  Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out.  The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites.  It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of the top nine priority groups by April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine?Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses.  Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track.  As seven mass vaccination centres opened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use, although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations.  All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nation will be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at home can now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.  Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

And England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a ""close contact"" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid. This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

Coronavirus: Boris Johnson criticised over bike ride seven miles from home," Boris Johnson has been criticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Street to go cycling during lockdown.  The Evening Standard reported the prime minister had been spotted in the Olympic Park in East London on Sunday. Government advice allows people to exercise outside, but says you should not travel outside your local area. A No 10 spokesman would not confirm if Mr Johnson had been driven to the park or cycled there, but said the PM had complied with Covid-19 guidelines. Labour's Andy Slaughter said: ""Once again it is do as I say, not as I do, from the prime minister.  The Hammersmith MP added: ""London has some of the highest infection rates in the country. Boris Johnson should be leading by example."" In response to the criticism, a Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The PM has exercised within the Covid rules and any suggestion to the contrary is wrong."" Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police''Concern' over Covid rule breakers in supermarketsWhat is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? A woman told the PA news agency she had seen the prime minister in the park: ""He was leisurely cycling with another guy with a beanie hat and chatting, while around four security guys, possibly more, cycled behind them. ""Considering the current situation with Covid I was shocked to see him cycling around looking so care-free.  ""Also, considering he's advising everyone to stay at home and not leave their area, shouldn't he stay in Westminster and not travel to other boroughs?"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at Monday's Downing Street press conference whether travelling seven miles for a cycle ride was within the rules. Mr Hancock said: ""It is OK, if you went for a long walk and ended up seven miles from home, that is OK, but you should stay local. ""It is OK to go for a long walk or a cycle ride or to exercise, but stay local."" The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after two women said they were surrounded by police and fine Â£200 after driving five miles from home to take a walk.  Derbyshire Police have now dropped the fine and apologised to the women, but the incident led to a debate over the guidance.  Government advice for England says you can leave your home to exercise, but adds: ""This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."" The guidance adds: ""Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."" In Scotland, the advice is more precise, saying exercise can be taken if it ""starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area"". Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who represents a constituency in the Lake District, has written to the PM calling for clearer guidance on exercise similar to that in Scotland. He wrote: ""On the one hand, our local police force here in Cumbria are reporting that people... have travelled hundreds of miles to take their exercise in the Lake District. ""And on the other hand, I have constituents writing to me, worried whether they will be punished for driving five minutes up the road to go for a walk in their local park."" Mr Farron added: ""We need a solution that clearly deters people from making lengthy trips and potentially spreading the virus, but also that doesn't discourage people from keeping fit and healthy.""",BBC News - UK Politics,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 19:31:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55620138
Covid-19: New test rule for UK arrivals from Friday," Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will be required for everyone travelling to the UK from 04:00 GMT on Friday.  People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. All those arriving from places not on the government's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. There are issues with testing availability and capacity, so some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda for six days. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently.  Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'UAE dropped from UK travel corridor listWhy is the UK bringing in travel testing? The government said all forms of PCR test would be accepted, as would other forms of test ""with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity"". The announcement comes after a further 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Monday. There were also 46,169 cases reported.  More than 32,000 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, data shows.

UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better'," The UK economy will ""get worse before it gets better"" as the country battles the pandemic, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned. The chancellor told MPs the new national restrictions were necessary to control the spread of coronavirus.  However, he said they would have a further significant economic impact, ""Even with the significant economic support we've provided, over 800,000 people have lost their job since February,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have not and will not be able to save every job and every business. ""But I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses."" The chancellor said ""the road ahead will be tough"", but maintained that the government was ""taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country"". He said that fiscal stimulus provided so far amounted to more than Â£280bn, while 1.2 million employers had furloughed almost 10 million employees. At the same time, three million people had benefited from self-employment grants. Mr Sunak said he would ""bear in mind"" calls to extend business rate relief and provide further support for the hospitality sector at the Budget in March. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of being ""out of ideas"" and providing ""nothing new"". She said: ""The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know."" The chancellor's words reflect the fact that with a widespread lockdown, the first months of 2021 are likely to see a further contraction in the UK economy and probably an official double-dip recession. This reflects the physical shutdown nationwide of hospitality and retail, as well as the effect in the data of school shutdowns too. In addition, consumers and workers are likely to be more cautious as the vaccine starts to be rolled out. So this is a very odd sort of economic tripwire. The challenge in the next weeks and months gets bigger, although not as big as it was last April. But beyond that, there is the hope of something normal. The implication for the chancellor as he prepares a vital early March Budget, however, is further delay to the measures, such as tax rises, to deal with historic levels of pandemic government borrowing.

"Covid: 'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Prof Whitty"," The UK will go through the ""most dangerous time"" of the pandemic in the weeks before vaccine rollout has an impact, England's chief medical officer has warned. Prof Chris Whitty urged people to minimise all unnecessary contact with others. The next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS, he said. Thousands more people are due to receive a vaccine this week after seven mass centres opened across England. NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. The government is aiming to offer vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. How does a vaccine get approvedHow will the UK vaccinate millions of people? NHS Covid-19 jab letters 'confusing over 80s' Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the government's vaccine delivery plan at a news conference later. He said the proposals would be the ""keystone of our exit out of the pandemic"". Outlining the vaccine rollout in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that ministers aim to give all over-80s the first dose of the vaccine over the next four weeks. The Welsh Government plans to offer a vaccine to all over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk by spring. In Northern Ireland, which is rolling out vaccines for care workers, health trusts have seen the busiest 48 hours since the start of the pandemic. Mr Hancock said on Sunday about two million people in the UK had been vaccinated so far. Over the weekend, the UK passed the milestone of 80,000 deaths with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.  Currently, around one in 50 people across the UK is infected and Prof Whitty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a very high chance that if you meet someone unnecessarily they will have Covid."" In a separate interview with BBC One's Breakfast, he said: ""This is everybody's problem. Any single unnecessary contact you have with someone is a potential link in a chain of transmission that will lead to a vulnerable person."" He said there were over 30,000 people [in English hospitals alone] with Covid-19 - compared to about 18,000 [in England] at the peak last April. He added that ""anybody who is not shocked"" by the number of people in hospital ""has not understood this at all"". ""This is an appalling situation,"" he said. In Essex, Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount of oxygen used to treat patients after supply ""reached a critical situation"", according to a document shared with the BBC. In Surrey, a temporary mortuary has been opened as hospital mortuaries have reached capacity. Almost 200 bodies are being stored at the emergency site, which is a former military hospital, and other local authorities have told the BBC they expect to open similar facilities soon. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England national medical director, said ""this is much bigger than the first wave back in April"". ""I don't think anyone in the NHS has known anything like this, this is a once-in-a-century pandemic,"" he said.  Prof Rupert Pearse, an intensive care doctor, told BBC Breakfast that in a ""normal"" winter it would be ""unlikely"" that more than three of four flu patients would need intensive care at any one time, but his unit is now running 130 intensive care beds because of the effects of Covid. ""To compare this to a normal winter flu epidemic is out of all proportion, it's orders of magnitude larger,"" he said. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.  Similar lockdown measures  are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers held two meetings on Sunday to discuss how to enforce the current lockdown measures more strictly and whether even tighter restrictions may be needed. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said no decisions on further restrictions were taken as there was a desire within government to wait until reliable data on existing measures becomes available in 10 days. However, he added there had been a discussion on better enforcement of existing regulations, including at shops and workplaces. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said ""we need to see the evidence behind nurseries"" remaining open. Asked whether tighter restrictions were needed, he said: ""I do think it's time to  hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". There is a lot of debate about whether the lockdown restrictions need to be tightened. There are certainly some anomalies. For example, we are told to only leave the home for essential purposes, but coffee shops remain open for takeaways and retail shops for click-and-collect in England and Wales. However, even if those elements are tightened up, there is a limit to what the government can do. It is why, in his round of media interviews on Monday, Prof Whitty repeatedly talked about individual decision-making. The mixing of different households continues. Some of it is allowed under the support bubble exemptions, but undoubtedly some of it is taking place outside of this. It is, after all, virtually impossible to police what goes on in people's homes. It is why messaging is so important - and so ministers and officials are stressing the pressure the NHS is under. A further tightening of the restrictions could also help make the point. But there is also a recognition this is hard. People are fatigued. A further crackdown could also erode goodwill. The vaccination programme is described as the biggest in NHS history. The seven mass testing sites, which NHS England said were chosen to give a geographical spread, are: Millennium Point, BirminghamAshton Gate, BristolExCel Centre, LondonManchester Tennis and Football CentreCentre for Life, NewcastleRobertson House, StevenageEpsom Downs Racecourse, Surrey The new centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of vaccinations each week and will be followed by ""dozens more"" large-scale sites, NHS England said. There will be about 1,200 vaccination sites when more GP-led and hospital services open later this week, along with the first pharmacy-led pilot sites, it added. LOOK-UP TOOL: How many cases in your area?YOUR QUESTIONS: We answer your queriesGLOBAL SPREAD: How many worldwide cases are there?THE R NUMBER: What it means and why it matters Some vulnerable people have questioned why they have been asked to travel to centres miles away from their homes during a pandemic, but the NHS has said people would not miss out on their vaccination if they wait for an appointment at a centre closer to home in the coming weeks. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said nobody should be asked to travel more than 10 miles to get a vaccine once more centres open. Asked on Today why the centres were not open 24 hours a day, he said it was ""more convenient"" for older people to attend during the day. ""If we need to go to 24-hour work we will absolutely go to 24 hours a day to make sure we vaccinate as quickly as we can,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We are limited by the amount of vaccine that is coming through the system."" Pharmaceutical firm Boots said its first vaccination site was due to open later this week to offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to the people most vulnerable. It said sites in Huddersfield and Gloucester were planned to open in the coming weeks. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK.

"New strangulation law planned to tackle abusers, says justice secretary"," Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said he hopes to make non-fatal strangulation a specific offence after a call by domestic abuse campaigners. Too many violent offenders' sentences are not tough enough, he said. And he added that strangulation can be a precursor to even more serious crimes against women. Campaigners argue that perpetrators are often only charged with common assault, which carries a maximum of six months in prison. Because non-fatal strangulation may not leave any marks on the victim, prosecutors do not bring more serious charges, they say. Calls for a new non-fatal strangulation offenceChange in strangling law 'would save lives' Mr Buckland said:Â ""There are too many violent offenders not getting sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their crimes because in many cases, prosecutors don't have adequate charging options where the victim has been strangled. ""The vast majority of these crimes are committed against women and they are often a precursor to even more serious violence."" The justice secretary hopes the new offence can be included in the Police and Sentencing Bill, although discussions are at an early stage.  Campaigners had called for a new offence to be part of the Domestic Abuse Bill. The Conservative peer Baroness Newlove was planning to table an amendment to this bill as it goes through the House of Lords. She won cross-party support during a debate in the Lords last week. But the Ministry of Justice believes that as non-fatal strangulation can be used in situations other than domestic abuse, the legislation should have a broader context. Welcoming the move, Nogah Ofer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence said: ""It is time that as a society we stopped normalising and ignoring strangulation. ""We look forward to police, prosecutors and medical professionals working together to address this with the seriousness it deserves, and hope that survivors of domestic abuse will have greater confidence to seek justice."" Campaigner Rachel Williams, who suffered strangulation during an abusive relationship, tweeted that it was ""a great victory"". She was shot and severely injured by her violent partner in 2011, who then killed himself. Last week, the government said that non-fatal strangulation was already covered by existing legislation from common assault to attempted murder.  It is now looking at how a new offence was introduced in New Zealand. Parts of Australia and the US have also brought in similar measures. During the Lords debate, crossbench peer Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a QC and former Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, warned that ""hurried law can be bad law"". He asked whether a more generic offence of aggravated assault or recklessly endangering life might cover these circumstances and questioned how strangulation and suffocation would be defined in the law.",BBC News - UK Politics,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 16:11:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55622596
Covid: Rule change allows parents to stay in hotels to see children," The government has changed coronavirus rules, allowing parents to stay in hotels so they can visit their child if they do not live with them. Previously parents could visit children during lockdown, but restrictions prevented them from staying overnight. The change, which came into force on Boxing Day, applies throughout lockdown in England and for all future tiers.  It follows a campaign by ex-BBC journalist Tom De Castella, who described the new rule as ""great news"". He said ""the worst aspect"" of the pandemic for him had been ""the way it has affected my ability to see my daughter"". Postcode check: Find out the rules where you liveWhat is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home?Children can still visit separated parents Mr De Castella added: ""She's three-years-old and lives in north Norfolk with her mum. I live in south London [and] the drive is about three and a half hours each way.  ""It's a long day. To do it two days running is a killer."" In November, he tried to book into a hotel in Norwich to allow him to see his daughter over successive days, only to be told it was not allowed.  ""Going as a separated parent was deemed to be a 'leisure' purpose by the hotel [and] only keyworkers could stay,"" the freelance journalist added. ""I checked the rules, there was nothing to treat me as an exemption to the lockdown rules. It had a massive bearing on seeing my daughter."" Mr De Castella said it was ""absurd"" that the rules treated seeing his daughter as a leisure activity.  ""This is about building a bond with your child, it's crucial to their development,"" he added.  ""It was massively frustrating for me. For my job I was allowed to go up there and stay in a hotel.

"Covid: Protect family incomes, Starmer urges ministers"," Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to ""protect family incomes"" as it deals with the economic effects of coronavirus. In his first speech of the year, he demanded teachers, the armed forces and care workers are left out of the public sector pay freeze. Sir Keir also called for tougher restrictions to be considered for tackling coronavirus.  No 10 said the government had ""shown it is prepared to act"". PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - SunakDrop 'absurd' 5% council tax increase - StarmerMillions 'face Â£1,000 benefit cut'Sunak faces backlash over public sector pay freeze With coronavirus restrictions and lockdowns shutting thousands of businesses, the economy was 7.9% smaller in October last year than it had been six months earlier. And the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, predicts that unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the middle of this year. In his speech, Sir Keir attacked the government for ""having been found wanting at every turn"", accusing Boris Johnson of being ""indecisive"" and acting ""too slow"" over further lockdowns and support for business and families. He said: ""The British people will forgive many things. They know the pandemic is difficult.  ""But they also know serial incompetence when they see it - and they know when a prime minister simply isn't up to the job."" But the PM's official spokeswoman rejected the criticism, saying: ""This government has shown it is prepared to act. When given evidence in the morning it has taken action that evening.""  Asked by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the government should tighten restrictions, such as closing nurseries, Sir Keir said there ""probably is more that we could do [and we] may have to get tougher"". But he did not outline what measures he would recommend, instead saying it was ""time to hear from the scientists what else can be done - and that probably should be done in the next few hours"". The Labour leader said ministers must ""protect family incomes and support businesses"" from the economic effects of previous restrictions and the current lockdown.  He added policies must ""make a real difference to millions of people across the country"" and ""put families at the heart of our recovery"". Sir Keir argued the Â£20-a-week rise given to Universal Credit claimants last April must continue beyond this April's cut-off point. Council tax increases in England of up to 5% this April must not happen, he said, while calling for the ban on evictions and repossessions to be extended. The government's pay freeze for at least 1.3 million public sector workers - which does not apply to NHS frontline staff and those earning below Â£24,000 a year - must not go ahead, said Sir Keir. ""I know this isn't everything that's needed,"" he added, ""and after so much suffering we can't go back the status quo.  ""We cannot return to an economy where over half our care workers earn less than the living wage, where childcare is among the most expensive in Europe, where our social care system is a national disgrace and where over four million children grow up in poverty."" An opposition leader has no policy leavers to pull. They have to rely on words to persuade the public they are worthy of power.  With the next general election an eternity away, Sir Keir Starmer knows the question of competence matters far more to voters than ideology right now.  The Labour leader was unsparing in his criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic - accusing the prime minster of serial incompetence, dithering and delay.  Sir Keir said the government could reverse planned changes to council tax and universal credit to ease the financial pressure on families.  But pressed on how lockdown might be different today if he was in No 10, the Labour leader mirrored the government's messaging.  He said there was ""probably"" more that could be done around nurseries and estate agent viewings, but Sir Keir's mantra was listen to the scientists.  It's what ministers say endlessly too.  Sir Keir argued that, just as a Labour government ""built the welfare state from the rubble"" of World War Two, a future one can ""secure our economy, protect our NHS and rebuild our country so that Britain is the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in"".  But Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling accused Sir Keir of ""calling for actions the Conservatives are already taking in government"". ""We have delivered an unprecedented Â£280bn package of support to protect jobs, livelihoods and public services through this pandemic,"" she added, including the furlough scheme, the temporary increase to Universal Credit and extra funding for councils. ""The Conservatives will continue to put families and communities at the heart of every decision we take as we deliver on our promises to the British people,"" Ms Milling said. In his Spending Review in November, Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun. He promised to take ""extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes"".

UK's biggest union elects first woman leader," Unison, the UK's biggest trade union, has elected a woman as leader for the first time. Christina McAnea won 47.7% of the vote and takes over as general secretary from Dave Prentis, who has been in the job since 2001.

""Health, care, council, police, energy, school, college and university staff have worked throughout the pandemic, and it's their skill and dedication that will see us out the other side. ""Their union will continue to speak up for them and do all it can to protect them in the difficult months ahead."" Unison is promising action against the government's pay freeze for 1.3 million public sector workers, which it has described as an ""attack"" on members' livelihoods. Ms McAnea said: ""Despite the risks, the immense pressures and their sheer exhaustion, the dedication and commitment of our key workers knows no end. I will not let this government, nor any future one, forget that."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has also demanded a U-turn on public sector pay, as he urges ministers to ""protect family incomes"" from the effects of lockdowns and other restrictions in his first speech of the year. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he cannot ""justify a significant, across-the-board"" salary increase while the economy and public finances are suffering in the wake of the pandemic. Ms McAnea, an experienced negotiator and former NHS worker, is expected to be broadly supportive of Sir Keir, as Mr Prentis has been. The Labour leader welcomed her victory, saying: ""I know you will be a brilliant representative for Unison members. ""And it's a significant moment for the union to elect its first woman general secretary. I look forward to working with you."" Her election comes at a strained time between Sir Keir and several other unions whose general secretaries have spoken out in support of his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, who is currently suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party. Mr Holmes came second in the Unison contest, with 33.8%, followed by Mr McKenzie, on 10.8%, and Mr Pierre, on 7.8%.

Covid: Morrisons and Sainsbury's ban maskless shoppers," Morrisons will bar customers who refuse to wear face coverings from its shops amid rising coronavirus infections. From Monday, shoppers who refuse to wear face masks offered by staff will not be allowed inside, unless they are medically exempt. Sainsbury's also said it would challenge those not wearing a mask or who were shopping in groups. The announcements come amid concerns that social distancing measures are not being adhered to in supermarkets. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government is ""concerned"" shops are not enforcing rules strictly enough. ""Ultimately, the most important thing to do now is to make sure that actually enforcement - and of course the compliance with the rules - when people are going into supermarkets are being adhered to,"" Mr Zahawi told Sky News. ""We need to make sure people actually wear masks and follow the one-way system,"" he said. What are the lockdown rules across the UK?Stricter Covid supermarket rules being considered in WalesWhat are the social distancing rules?Should I wear a face covering in the supermarket? Morrisons said it had ""introduced and consistently maintained thorough and robust safety measures in all our stores"" since the start of the pandemic. But it said: ""From today we are further strengthening our policy on masks.""  Security guards at the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain will be enforcing the new rules. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won't be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. ""Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family, please be kind."" Following Morrisons' announcement, Sainsbury's said that it was also putting trained security guards at the front of its stores to challenge shoppers who did not comply. Chief executive Simon Roberts said: ""I've spent a lot of time in our stores reviewing the latest situation over the last few days and on behalf of all my colleagues, I am asking our customers to help us keep everyone safe.  ""The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups.  ""Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone. Everyone's care and consideration matters now more than ever."" Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi stopped short of saying that supermarket staff should be responsible for enforcing rules on face masks. Enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, not retailers. Wearing face masks in supermarkets and shops is compulsory across the UK.  In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. However, retail industry body the British Retail Consortium said that, workers have faced an increase in incidents of violence and abuse when trying to encourage shoppers to put them on. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, added: ""Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond.  ""Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers."" Under current lockdown restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people must only leave home for essential reasons, such as buying food or medicine. In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, supermarkets introduced social distancing measures during the UK's first nationwide lockdown last March. They included limits on the numbers of customers in the shops at any one time, protective plastic screens at tills and ""marshals"" to ensure shoppers were maintaining a two-metre distance. But amid rising numbers of infections, some have expressed concerns about a ""lack of visible protections"" implemented by supermarkets in recent weeks. The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday that he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown as people were worried the strict enforcement of rules did not ""appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket Waitrose said that it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to the virus, with marshals checking that customers are wearing face coverings on the door, hand sanitiser stations at its entrances and written communications to shoppers reminding them to maintain their distance. Tesco said it was limiting the number of customers in store and was also reminding customers to wear masks. ""We have clear signage explaining this, and we have packs of face coverings available for purchase near the front of our stores for any customers who have forgotten them."" Meanwhile, Asda announced last week that it would extend its marshals' hours to 08:00 to 20:00 and increase how often baskets and trollies are cleaned. Shop workers' union Usdaw has also called for firms to apply more stringent measures again. The union's general secretary, Paddy Lillis, said that it had received reports that ""too many customers are not following necessary safety measures like social distancing, wearing a face covering and only shopping for essential items"". ""It is going to take some time to roll out the vaccine and we cannot afford to be complacent in the meantime, particularly with a new strain sweeping the nation,"" Mr Lillis said. The trade union also suggested that ""'one-in one-out"" policies and proper queuing systems should be reintroduced in supermarkets.  It added that these systems should be managed by trained security staff where necessary. ",BBC News - UK Politics,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:33:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55618408
Covid: May elections 'will almost certainly be delayed'," Elections due to take place on 6 May will ""almost certainly"" be postponed due to the coronavirus, Conservative MP Steve Brine has said. Labour's Meg Hillier said she could not see ""any option but for some delay"". Voters are set to go to the polls in May for council and mayoral elections in England - and parliamentary elections in Scotland and Wales. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said the May date would be kept under review. Can Scotland hold an election during the pandemic?Councils call for urgent decision on English pollsNew law for possible Senedd election Covid delay Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, Mr Brine said: ""I've been talking to my local party about it and I've been talking to [Conservative] Central Office about it. I just cannot see how you could do that."" He said some activists were already ""out delivering leaflets - they're opening gates, touching letterboxes, putting bits of papers through doors in a lockdown with a highly virulent virus.  ""It is deeply dangerous, it is deeply irresponsibleâ¦ if you push the election back it pushes back that temptation."" Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Ms Hillier said she was ""surprised the government hasn't thought about this before"", adding that election organisers would be making decisions about the 6 May polls this week.   ""I can't see any option but for some delay,"" she said, but added: ""I would hate to see a very long delay because it's really bad for democracy. ""And actually, politicians standing for election want to get on with their elections usually because being held to account by the electorate... we rather relish that."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said her party was not asking activists to deliver campaign material at the moment, but that last summer canvassers had been provided with personal protective equipment PPE to make it ""as safe as possible"".  Having postponed planned elections in England last year due to the pandemic, many want the May vote to take place - including ministers, I'm told.  But there is real concern about the practicalities; how to safely conduct the poll given likely social distancing, whether enough venues and staff would be available and how much it all might cost. The official government line is that the date is set, albeit subject to review depending on the course of the virus.  But discussions are taking place. Council leaders and officials, tasked with running the elections, are pressing for clarity from government - and sooner rather than later.  In the end, as if often the case, politics may be the deciding factor. If a May vote means no campaigning can take place in advance, political pressure may force a shift.  If there is a delay, though, many want it to be weeks or months rather than wait another year before people have a say about who represents them. Last week the County Councils Network urged the prime minister to decide ""as soon as possible"" whether elections should go ahead. And the BBC has learned that in Manchester the region's leaders have spoken with the government about a delay. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who is up for re-election, said he would recommend contests being restricted to postal voting, if they do go ahead in May.  The Cabinet Office has previously said measures could be implemented at ""short notice"" to allow more people to cast their votes by post including those self-isolating in the run-up to election day.  In Scotland, any change to the election date would be a decision for the Scottish Parliament, rather than the government, and MSPs have introduced contingency plans which would allow the vote to be pushed back by up to six months. And in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""committed"" to the 6 May polling date but he wants to ""allow some flexibility"" - and a new law is being planned to make it possible to delay the election if needed.

£3bn UK climate finance to be spent on supporting nature," The UK will spend at least Â£3bn of international climate finance on nature and biodiversity over five years, the Prime Minister has said. Boris Johnson made the announcement in a virtual address to the One Planet Summit for biodiversity in Paris. The PM said the investment was needed to protect nature, including marine life, forests and sustainable food production. Prince Charles has also spoken at the event. In his address, Mr Johnson said humanity is destroying species and habitats at ""an absolutely unconscionable rate"". He said the Â£3bn, which forms part of the UK's Â£11.6bn contribution to a climate finance initiative, would go to ""protecting nature, whether it's marine life or timber conservation or sustainable food production"". Extinction crisis: Leaders say it is time to actBiodiversity: Why the nature crisis matters, in five graphics Programmes supported by the funding will include marine conservation, tackling deforestation and efforts to conserve habitats such as mangroves that protect local communities from the impacts of climate change. The PM added: ""Obviously it's right to focus on climate change, obviously it's right to cut CO2 emissions but we won't achieve a real balance with our planet, unless we protect nature as well."" And he spoke of the pandemic, saying it ""was the product of an imbalance in man's relationship with natural world"", originating from a ""collision between mankind and the natural world"".  The UK is committing to protect 30% of its land and ocean by the end of the decade.

Former Tory MSP to lead Scots wing of rebranded Brexit Party," Former Conservative MSP Michelle Ballantyne is to lead the Scottish wing of Reform UK - the party set up as a rebrand of the Brexit Party. Ms Ballantyne currently sits as an independent MSP for South Scotland, having quit the Tories in November. The ""new"" party is to put up candidates for the Holyrood elections in May and develop its own manifesto. Ms Ballantyne said it would be pro-UK, pro-Brexit and in favour of low taxes and encouraging entrepreneurs. The Brexit Party formally changed its name to Reform UK earlier in January after winning approval from the Electoral Commission, but is still led by Nigel Farage. Chairman Richard Tice said the Scottish party would champion ""grown-up debate"" about reforming politics and devolving powers from Holyrood to local councils. MSP Michelle Ballantyne quits Scottish Tories Ms Ballantyne - who became an MSP in 2017 via the regional list system - was a candidate for the Scottish Conservative leadership in February 2020, but ultimately lost out to Jackson Carlaw and left the party citing policy differences in November. She said the new party would ""make the positive case for the union"", but said she would ""not spend hours and hours talking about the constitutional arguments"", saying this should be kept for ""when the country is back on its feet"". She said: ""Unionists and nationalists can and must come together now for the shared goal of rebuilding Scotland. ""Reform UK Scotland will champion personal choice, community response and local networks. Our policies will reflect these values and respect the basic rights of freedom of thought, speech and worship."" The party will contest the regional lists at May's Holyrood election, although Mr Farage has voiced doubts about whether the vote will go ahead due to the pandemic. The Brexit Party placed second in the European Parliament elections in Scotland in 2019, but secured just 0.5% of the vote in the Westminster election later that year while fielding candidates in 15 out of 59 seats north of the border. The party's name change was contested by the non-partisan think tank Reform, who said the Electoral Commission's decision to allow the move was ""incredibly disappointing"".",BBC News - UK Politics,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 15:02:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-55617824
Trump Twitter ban 'raises regulation questions' - Hancock," Bans imposed by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Donald Trump's accounts raise a ""very big question"" about how social media is regulated, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The companies acted after supporters of the US president stormed Washington DC's Capitol building on Wednesday. Mr Hancock said the bans showed they were now ""taking editorial decisions"". Campaigners want social media to be treated as ""publishers"", rather than ""platforms"", meaning more regulation. But opponents of the idea argue that it could allow governments to limit debate.

Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". But Mr Trump called this an attack on free speech and suggested he would look at ""building out our own platform in the future"". There has been a long-running debate over whether social media companies should be treated in law as ""publishers"", with greater responsibility for dealing with libellous, discriminatory, misleading or incendiary content posted by users. Mr Hancock, a former culture secretary, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump - the scenes at the Capitol - were terrible - and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. ""But there's something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That's clear because they're choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice on their platform."" Mr Hancock said that development was likely to have ""consequences"". Asked earlier about Twitter's decision to ban Mr Trump's account, he told Sky News: ""I think it raises a very important question, which is it means that the social media platforms are taking editorial decisions. ""And that is a very big question because then it raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they're regulated."" Twitter's ban on Mr Trump's account followed the increasing use of warning labels on his posts referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the result of the US presidential election.

""The vast majority of the public have supported this huge national effort and followed the rules,"" Ms Patel said.

Covid-19: Rapid tests for asymptomatic people to be rolled out," Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week, the government has said. The community testing regime - expanded to cover all 317 local authorities - uses rapid lateral flow tests, which can return results in 30 minutes. Local councils are being encouraged to prioritise tests for those who cannot work from home during the lockdown. The health secretary said asymptomatic testing can help break transmission. Meanwhile, NHS England has invited tens of thousands of people over 80 to book vaccinations. Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warn Postcode check: Find out the rules where you liveWhat's still allowed during lockdown? A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 54,940 cases reported, according to government figures on Sunday. The total number of deaths in the UK after a positive test passed 80,000 on Saturday. The government has launched a campaign telling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Department of Health and Social Care said expanding the Community Testing Programme to more people without symptoms was ""crucial given that around one in three people"" who contract Covid-19 show no symptoms.  It said regular community testing using the rapid tests had already identified more than 14,800 positive Covid-19 cases. So far, 131 local authorities in England have enrolled in the government's community testing programme, with Milton Keynes, Slough, Doncaster and Essex the latest to join. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said targeted asymptomatic testing and subsequent isolation was ""highly effective in breaking chains of transmission"". But Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol Medical School, said increasing lateral flow testing was ""very worrying"" and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases ""will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests"". Defending lateral flow tests on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Mr Hancock said mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool had seen the case rate drop ""more sharply than it did in other similar areas where only restrictions were brought in"". NHS Test and Trace will also work closely with other government departments to scale up workforce testing, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Many are already piloting regular workforce testing, with 15 large employers having taken up this offer already across 64 sites, ""including organisations operating in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks and the military"". The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place for rapid testing of staff and students in schools and colleges and staff in primary schools. Asked when schools could reopen by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Hancock said there were four conditions: that there is not a major new variant, the vaccine rollout is proceeding effectively, the number of deaths is falling and there is an easing of pressure on the NHS. Businesses have welcomed asymptomatic testing.  Matthew Fell, of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said: ""This expansion of testing will help more critical workers and those unable to work from home to operate safely, while also catching new cases more swiftly."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the safety of the workforce had been an ""absolute priority"" and said the expansion of testing means ""we can keep our economy on the move while giving individuals in key sectors complete confidence that their workplace is safe"".

Covid-19: Drop 'absurd' 5% council tax increase - Starmer," ""Absurd"" council tax rises should be scrapped to ease the pressure on family budgets, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said. Local authorities in England will be able to raise council tax by 5% from April, with 3% used to top up adult social care budgets. Sir Keir said this meant those living in a band D property could see bills rise by an average of Â£90. He added that the prime minister should provide extra funding to councils. But the government says the rise in council tax bills, plus extra money from central government, will ensure a real-terms increase in support for local services. Council tax to rise by up to 5% next yearCouncil tax 'likely to rise' after Sunak reviewEconomic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Sir Keir wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: ""It is absurd that during the deepest recession in 300 years, at the very time millions are worried about the future of their jobs and how they will make ends meet, Boris Johnson and [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak are forcing local government to hike up council tax. ""The prime minister said he would do 'whatever is necessary' to support local authorities in providing vital services - he needs to make good on that promise."" Sir Keir urged Mr Johnson to ""give families the security they need"" by dropping the tax increase. He said families had been treated as an ""afterthought"" by the government during the pandemic, adding that Labour would become the ""party of the family"" under his leadership. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""Council tax plays an important role in helping fund the frontline services needed to respond to the pandemic. ""Our approach strikes a balance between allowing local authorities to address service pressures and ensuring local residents have the final say on excessive increases."" A Â£500m fund to support people struggling with finances meant councils could ""cut bills further for some of the most vulnerable households"", they added, while a Â£7.2bn support package would help meet ""the major Covid-19 service pressures in their local area"". The chancellor's Spending Review in November set out the cost to the UK economy so far of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Sunak warned the ""economic emergency"" caused by the pandemic had only begun, with lasting damage to growth and jobs. Interviewed on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said there was no scope for a ""major renegotiation"" of the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, but added that there were ""bits already that need to be improved on"". And, asked about the possibility of another Scottish referendum on independence from the UK, he said that a ""further, divisive"" vote was not ""the way forward"". ""But I do accept that the status quo isn't working"", Sir Keir added. ""I don't accept the argument that the status quo isn't working, the next thing you do is go to a referendum."" The prime minister has said such a vote - last held in 2014 - should be a ""once-in-a-generation"" event. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum should take place.

Covid-19: Government denies 'snubbing' BT's wi-fi for pupils offer," The government has denied it ""snubbed"" an offer from telecoms giant BT to provide disadvantaged children with internet access for remote learning.  BT said the government had ""struggled to distribute"" the wi-fi vouchers and ""effectively handed them back to us"". However a spokesman for the education department said a pilot of the scheme had not provided ""reliable and consistent"" internet connection. UK schools are closed to most pupils as part of coronavirus lockdown measures.  Teachers have had to revert to online learning, as was the case during the first lockdown in the Spring. However concerns has been raised over how this is impacting disadvantaged families who don't have internet access.  How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data feesBBC to put lessons on TV during lockdown In a letter to BT, Labour MP Sarah Owen urged the company to provide school children ""who cannot afford it with internet access so that they can learn, achieve and stay connected"". In response Marc Allera, head of BT's consumer brands division, said: ""BT was the first telecoms operator to have an offer for vulnerable families"", adding that it had offered BT wi-fi vouchers from June 2020. ""Unfortunately the Department of Education struggled to distribute these vouchers effectively and handed them back to us,"" he wrote. The pressure is on both the government and telecoms companies to do more to close the digital divide. It was while defending its own approach to a Labour MP that BT revealed the free broadband offer it had made to the education secretary. BT Basic is, as the name implies, a pretty basic service offering a phone line and a 10Mbps broadband service to anyone on Universal Credit or other benefits for Â£10 a month. It seems that Gavin Williamson did not find an invitation to subsidise a slow service which would still leave a family struggling to video stream lessons very attractive.  There would also have been competition issues in the use of public money to back a dominant player in the fiercely competitive broadband market. Nevertheless, having failed to come up with convincing answers to closing the digital divide during last Spring's lockdown, both the government and the telecoms giant are now scrambling to show they can do better this time around. BT also said it offered to prioritise putting vulnerable families on an ""affordable broadband tariff"". ""The department declined this route, wanting something faster,"" he added: ""We regret this decision as had the Department for Education taken this approach then many of these families would have affordable and unlimited broadband by now."" BT has said it is now offering ""free unlimited"" mobile data for families without internet access and that, by the end of the month, it aims to implement zero-rating of popular education websites, meaning children won't lose data when on these sites. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said it was ""shocking and utterly disgraceful"" that education secretary Gavin Williamson had ""snubbed an offer of cheap broadband for kids"". However, the government said her claims were ""completely wrong"".  ""The department did pilot the BT WiFi Hotspot scheme, but it did not suitably meet children and young people's needs for a reliable and consistent internet connection to access remote education,"" a spokesman said.  ""The families involved reported poor coverage and intermittent connection."" The row comes amid warnings that some schools could be inundated with pupils without laptops during the current lockdown after a change to the vulnerable pupil list.",BBC News - UK Politics,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 13:18:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55588748
COP26: Alok Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role," Alok Sharma is to leave his position as business secretary to focus full-time on his role as president of the UN COP26 climate conference in November. The Glasgow event is expected to be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted. Mr Sharma, who will remain in the cabinet, said he was ""delighted to have been asked by the PM to dedicate all my energies"" to the position. Kwasi Kwarteng replaces him as business secretary while Anne-Marie Trevelyan becomes the new energy minister. The government says a successful summit will be critical if the UK wants to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. The event had originally been scheduled for November 2020 but was delayed by a year due to Covid-19. Sharma 'overloaded' to juggle UN summit role2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on recordWhy 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The BBC's political correspondent Jessica Parker said the decision to move Alok Sharma wasn't a surprise and would be seen as a recognition of the need to free him up to do more of the crucial diplomatic leg-work required. Some MPs had previously warned that Mr Sharma lacked the ""bandwidth"" to head the conference alongside his cabinet job, especially given the strains on business due to the pandemic.  In his new role, which is based in the Cabinet Office, Mr Sharma's will remain a member of Boris Johnson's top team but be focused solely on coordinating global action to tackle climate change Boris Johnson chose Mr Sharma to head the event after ex-minister Claire O'Neill was ousted from the position in the summer of 2019.  She later condemned what she called broken promises and backsliding on climate commitments. Former Conservative PM David Cameron turned down the chance to head the conference and ex-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague was also involved in discussions.  Mr Sharma's move will be welcomed by climate campaigners, who worried he was over-stretched running a frantically busy department while also orchestrating the most important climate meeting on Earth. Many of these summits - known as COPs - yielded little because the leadership was poor.  The French produced a triumphant agreement in the 2015 Paris COP after mustering the mighty force of French diplomacy. Mr Sharma is reported to accept that he now needs to concentrate full time on the challenge. He will need subtle diplomatic skills, a mastery of detail and the stamina of an ox as he attempts to corral world leaders into agreement on curbing emissions faster. He'll also need 100% support from the PM. The greatest obstacle to action - Donald Trump - will soon disappear from the scene, and with China making bold promises, the COP has potential.  But politicians have been so slow to act that some key tipping points in the climate might already have been breached. Reflecting on his new role, Mr Sharma said: ""The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations. ""Through the UK's Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal."" Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: ""Allowing Alok Sharma to focus full-time on his COP26 role is a sensible decision, not least as it signals the government's commitment to ensuring that the summit is a success. ""With the election of Joe Biden as the next US President and China's recent carbon neutrality pledge, the diplomatic opportunities have opened up for more ambitious action on climate change. Mr Sharma's job will be to seize them.""  And ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who led the UK delegation at the Paris climate change conference, said the move showed the government ""recognises the importance and opportunity for a global agreement this year"". Responding to his new appointment, Mr Kwarteng said he was ""thrilled"" and pledged to help businesses through this period of ""extremely challenging circumstances"".  The Spelthorne MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, has been energy minister since July 2019.  Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Kwarteng had ""a massive task"" in providing business with ""a plan to help them through this year, not the inadequate sticking plaster measures we have seen"".  He welcomed the decision to make Mr Sharma's COP role full time. ""It's absolutely crucial that the full political, diplomatic and strategic resources of government are now directed to the most ambitious outcome at Glasgow, which is a 1.5 degree deal.""",BBC News - UK Politics,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 18:43:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55588750
Moderna becomes third Covid vaccine approved in the UK," Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""excellent news"" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.  It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS.  The UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. It is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published.  There are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future.  Around 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. That figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people?When will you be eligible for a Covid vaccine? Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK.  The prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.  Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease."" The UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible.  In total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19. Nadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: ""The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live. ""The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster."" The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.  In comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. The AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature. All of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid.  No vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last.  People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others.  EU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine.",BBC News - UK Politics,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 16:33:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55586410
Covid-19: Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal'," Flexing the coronavirus lockdown rules could be fatal, the health secretary has warned as hospital admissions soar. Matt Hancock did not rule out strengthening current restrictions and told the BBC's Andrew Marr the NHS was under ""very serious pressure"". It comes after almost 55,000 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and the number of deaths after a positive test passed 80,000. Scientist Prof Peter Horby warned the UK was in ""the eye of the storm"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the rules were tough but ""may not be tough enough"" and called for the government to hold daily press conferences to avoid ""mixed messages"". The UK recorded another 563 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test on Sunday, down from 1,065 deaths on Saturday. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were also a further 54,940 daily cases. What's still allowed during lockdown?How will the UK vaccinate millions of people?  Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr ""every time you try to flex the rules that could be fatal"" and said staying at home was the ""most important thing we can do collectively as a society"". The health secretary said he did not want to speculate on whether the government would further strengthen restrictions, after warnings from scientists on Saturday that they may need to be stricter.  ""People need to not just follow the letter of the rules but follow the spirit as well and play their part,"" he said. His comments came after Home Secretary Priti Patel defended police over enforcing lockdown rules following the case of two women who were fined for going for a walk five miles from their homes - a decision which is now under review. The government has launched a campaign telling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said that if the virus continued on its current trajectory ""many hospitals will be in real difficulties, and very soon"". In a statement released on Sunday, he said that unless people started to follow the rules more strictly, emergency patients will have to be turned away from hospitals, causing ""avoidable deaths"". Prof Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there may be ""early signs that something is beginning to bite"" due to the restrictions - but if they did not then stricter measures would be needed. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I really hope people take this very seriously. It was bad in March, it's much worse now. ""We've seen record numbers across the board, record numbers of cases, record numbers of hospitalisations, record numbers of deaths."" Prof Horby said tougher measures might include those during the March lockdown, such as people only being able to exercise once a day and stricter rules about meeting people. ""We are in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky,"" he said. Prof Horby said early signs were encouraging that the vaccines would be effective against the new Covid variants - first identified in the UK and in South Africa - and he did not want people to ""hide under the duvet"".  ""We can see the end game now,"" he said. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more deaths.  The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the start of December.  The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more ""transmissible"", possibly because each infected individual produces more of the actual virus - sometimes referred to as the viral load.  Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from serious symptoms but we don't yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual contracting the virus and passing it on to others.  Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be needed to bring the R-number below one and start to reduce the overall size of the pandemic.  Mass community testing is to be rolled out this week, the government has said, and the health secretary said around two million people had been vaccinated in the UK, with some 200,000 jabs being given in England daily. Mr Hancock said by autumn every adult in the UK would be offered a vaccine. He said the government was on course to reach its target of 15 million people vaccinated by mid-February, with the opening of seven mass vaccination centres this week likely to increase the rate of jabs. Mr Hancock told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he hoped coronavirus could be treated like seasonal flu with an annual vaccination programme in the future. Prof Horby said the vaccines may have to be updated ""every few years"" as the virus mutates and said it was unlikely the virus would go away completely. ""We're going to have to live with it,"" he said. ""But that may change significantly.  ""It may well become more of an endemic virus that's with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths but is not causing the huge disruption that we're seeing now.""

Renters: Eviction bans in England and Wales are extended," Eviction bans in England and Wales have been extended, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served for six weeks in England and longer in Wales. Current restrictions were due to end on Monday, but charities have called for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates. In the last month, bailiffs have been unable to serve notices and enforce evictions in England and Wales, dubbed a Christmas truce. Evictions were banned at the start of the first lockdown in March - and ministers extended the notice period landlords must give from three to six months. CourtsÂ began to clear the backlog of repossession casesÂ in September, starting with the most serious cases such as those involving domestic violence or anti-social behaviour. More families 'trapped in temporary accommodation'12 basic tasks in lockdown - what has changed?Property site listings exclude renters on benefits With some of those set to come through, charities and opposition parties have been calling for an extension to the bailiff ban, given the stricter restrictions and greater threat of Covid transmission. Housing is a devolved issue. In Scotland, the ban on eviction orders, which was due to expire on 22 January, was extended to the end of March on Thursday. This will apply to all evictions in areas subject to level three or four restrictions, except in cases of serious anti-social behaviour, including domestic abuse.Â  Now, in Wales, plans have been announced to extend its ban to the end of March with ministers saying this ""is an extremely difficult time for many people and renters should not be forced out of their homes"". Also on Friday, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick announced the bailiff ban will be extended to 21 February in England. He said that councils would also be given Â£10m to ""redouble their efforts"" to accommodate rough sleepers. ""At the start of this pandemic we made sure that the most vulnerable in society were protected. This winter, we are continuing in this vein and redoubling our efforts to help those most in need,"" he said. ""Our ongoing 'Everyone In' initiative is widely regarded as one of the most successful of its kind in the world, ensuring 33,000 people are safe in accommodation. We are now going further and focusing on GP registration of rough sleepers."" He said this was aimed at ensuring that rough sleepers did not miss out on Covid vaccines. Concerns about homelessness and crowded accommodation have risen during the Covid crisis. Half a million private tenants in the UK are behind with their rent, according to research by Citizens Advice. It said this was a new problem for many of them, suggesting 58% were not in arrears last February, before the pandemic hit people's jobs and finances.  The charity said that those who had fallen behind on rent owed at average of Â£730.  It was among a collection of charities calling for financial support for renters, pointing out that homeowners had seen the benefit of mortgage holidays. One student told Citizens Advice that he was in a state of constant worry over the threat of eviction. He was unable to supplement his student loan with work, as he had previously, and benefits failed to fill the gap. His letting agent declined his request for a temporary rent reduction. ""I've no idea what might happen, and that's the scary thing. Every day I'm waiting for a letter to say that he [the landlord] wants to sell the place, or change the tenancy or something like that,"" he said.  ""It's always in the back of my mind that you're going to get home and there's an [eviction] letter."" The UK government has announced that, from next month, tenants and landlords may be able to use a mediation service to iron out disputes and keep people in their homes. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said the UK government's response was ""not good enough"".  ""The virus is more rampant than ever before, yet the government action does not measure up to what was done in March,"" she said. Landlords groups have also called on the UK government for financial support in England. They point out that many people who let out a home do not have a large portfolio of properties, and would also have faced the threat of income loss of redundancy from regular jobs. However, the National Residential Landlords Association said ministers were ""doing more harm than good"" by ""repeatedly banning repossessions"" as this simply stacked up more tenant debt on top of their existing arrears. ""The repossessions ban is a sticking plaster that will ultimately lead to more people losing their homes,"" said the association's chief executive Ben Beadle. ""Instead the government should recognise the crisis facing many tenants and take immediate action to enable them to pay their debts as is happening in Scotland and Wales. The objective should be to sustain tenancies in the long term and not just the short term.""  In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the pandemic.",BBC News - UK Politics,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 15:57:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55586081

Will trade union contests help or hinder Keir Starmer?," On Monday, the new general secretary of the UK's biggest union - Unison - will be announced. Under its outgoing leader Dave Prentis, the union backed Sir Keir Starmer's successful Labour leadership bid. And Sir Keir can currently rely on support from the union's representatives on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC). The outcome of the contest could have consequences for that support. The expectation is that one of the assistant general secretaries, Christina McAnea, will prevail and become the first woman to lead the union. She has a strong background as a negotiator and has shown little interest in internal Labour politics, but is expected to be broadly supportive of the party's current leadership. But the outcome isn't certain. Unison boss stepping down after 20 years in roleUnite decides to cut Labour affiliation moneyStop wrangling over Corbyn, unions tell Labour She has faced a strong challenge from another assistant general secretary - Roger Mackenzie - who has the backing of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He hopes to be the first candidate from a BAME background to take the top job. His chances of victory may be undermined by the fact that two other candidates - Paul Holmes and Hugo Pierre - have also been competing for the Left vote. But, Mr Mackenzie's campaign was given a fillip when Mr Corbyn was suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party, giving him a defining rallying cry. And developments are expected soon in the country's second biggest union - Unite.  Unite is the biggest trade union funder of the Labour Party so whoever succeeds Len McCluskey as general secretary could determine how generous, or otherwise, it is in its contributions. Mr McCluskey still has not announced exactly when he will stand down and can stay in office until next year,  but the election contest to succeed him is expected to take place this year. While the potential successors have agreed not to campaign openly, insiders say there has been something of a ""phoney war"" going on. The United Left faction is backing Steve Turner, an assistant general secretary who has declared he does not want ""a war of attrition"" with the Labour leadership. Another assistant general secretary - Howard Beckett - complained that there were irregularities in the United Left ballot which backed Mr Turner and he will challenge for the top job from the Left. Unlike Mr Turner, he has been an outspoken critic of Sir Keir and is one of the union's representatives on Labour's NEC He led a left-wing walkout (or a zoom 'switch off') from the NEC in November, denouncing what he called ""Keir Starmer's factionalism"". He and his colleagues were not just unhappy at Mr Corbyn's treatment by the party leadership but the elevation of another Beckett - Dame Margaret - to the chair of the NEC rather than a more left-wing member, trade unionist Ian Murray.  But it seems another candidate in the forthcoming Unite contest is about to emerge. Next week, I'm told, a new grouping in the union will be formed - Workers' Unite. This grouping - made up of grassroots activists - is likely to morph in to a campaign to support Sharon Graham when a formal contest gets under way.  She has said she would stand when there is a vacancy. She is the union's executive officer for ""organising and leverage"", who has overseen successful industrial disputes and would be the first female general secretary were she to succeed. One of the leading figures behind Workers' Unite is Kathy Smith, a member of the union's executive representing local government workers. She told the BBC that Sharon Graham ""would be a breath of fresh air"" at the top of the union. According to its launch literature, a major theme of the Workers' Unite campaign will be to ""move beyond internal Labour Party politics"" and ""to always prioritise the workplace"". That is likely to be met with relief by those around Sir Keir.   Sharon Graham and supporter Kathy Smith are both on the Left. But Ms Smith believes any campaign for the leadership of the union would appeal beyond that base by focusing on ""the members' priorities: jobs, pay and terms and conditions. Not contemplating our belly buttons."" And she argues that Ms Graham's willingness not just to negotiate with big employers - such as British Airways - but to stand on picket lines in local disputes will help build solid support among grassroots activists. The candidate Len McCluskey beat in the Unite leadership election in 2017 - Gerard Coyne - has thrown his hat in the ring again. Seen as an anti-Corbyn candidate by many members of Labour's parliamentary party last time round, he unsuccessfully challenged the union's internal electoral processes following his defeat in what was a particularly bitter contest.  But if the Left territory in the union is going to be fought over, Mr Coyne seems to have calculated that he could - in a first-past-the-post contest - prevail.

Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit?," It's been a week since the UK ended its transition period and completed its separation from the European Union.  British companies found themselves having to fill out customs forms to export to European countries, but we have not seen big queues on motorways in Kent that some feared.   In many ways, it's been business as usual at the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel. A steady stream of lorries has been boarding ferries and trains to France.   But the new year has also brought new checks for hauliers.  Predictions of gridlock in Kent have failed to materialise, but traffic is still exceptionally low - probably down to stockpiling in the run up to Christmas.   As more hauliers return to the roads, the new system will face sterner tests - particularly as Covid testing for anyone wanting to travel to France is set to continue for at least another couple of weeks. The Department for Transport said at least 90% of lorries trying make the Dover-Calais ferry crossing or going through the Channel Tunnel had the correct paperwork, including proof of a negative test for coronavirus.  But on Thursday, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) told BBC News that about one in five trucks were being turned away. And the ferry company DFDS tweeted on Friday: ""We are experiencing a high volume of vehicles being refused and delayed at the Ports of Calais, Dunkerque and Dover, due to incorrect paperwork being presented at check-in.""  The RHA estimated that there were about 2,000 lorries a day in each direction making the Dover-Calais ferry crossing and going through the Channel Tunnel compared with a normal daily figure of between 5,000-6,000. John Glen, chief economist for the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, told BBC News he had heard from customs clearance agents working in Dover that there was a lack of preparation from businesses and a lack of capacity from the customs brokers that businesses have been employing to help. That is expected to improve over time, but people involved ""are worried that demand will increase faster than capacity does"", he said. The boss of Sainsbury's also said that while the flow of goods had been going well so far the real test would be in a few weeks when there were normal levels of traffic. M&S Percy Pig sweets hit by Brexit red tapeJohn Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries John Glen added that many of the problems before Christmas had been because ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton had been log-jammed, partly because dock staff had been off sick. That meant ships had been avoiding UK ports and dropping containers off in Antwerp or Zeebrugge instead, leaving them to be transported by road, which increased the problems for roll-on roll-off ports such as Dover. The Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says ""significant additional disruption"" is expected at the border in the coming weeks, particularly on the Dover-Calais route.  He said the government would have to ""redouble our efforts to communicate the precise paperwork that's required"" and acknowledged that there were ""specific challenges"" facing the UK seafood sector. The Scottish Seafood Association has complained of disruption and ""red tape"" delays to exports to the EU.   There have been reports of other issues in the first week: Business leaders said there had been ""significant problems"" with goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Six lorries on the first ferry arriving in Belfast on 1 January were delayed because of incomplete paperworkWhile the UK government managed to roll over most of the third country trade deals it had as part of the EU that did not include Ghana. It was mentioned in Parliament this week that a tariff (or import tax) of Â£17,500 had been charged at Portsmouth on a shipment of bananas from Ghana There has been confusion about customs declarations on parcels going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, with some retailers such as John Lewis suspending deliveries. Northern Ireland Economy Minister Diane Dodds wrote to the UK government saying: ""there is significant cause for concern from both businesses and consumers""The Japanese carmaker Honda suspended production at its Swindon factory blaming global supply delays. It had also done so in December due to congestion at portsParents of children with severe epilepsy said they had no longer been able to get their prescriptions for a particular medicinal cannabis oil from the Netherlands. The health secretary said he was working with the Dutch government to find a solutionSome specialist online retailers in EU countries have stopped delivering to the UK saying that they would face higher costs and increased bureaucracy to comply with UK tax authorities  Trading in shares in companies in EU countries that had previously taken place in London moved to exchanges in other European countriesThe Federation of Small Businesses says a lot of UK firms have temporarily suspended EU imports and exports to see how new changes bed in before deciding on next steps.

Covid in Scotland: How do you hold an election during lockdown?," Scotland has entered a new Covid-19 lockdown, but is also preparing to go to the polls in just a few months time. How can an election take place during a pandemic, and what plans are in place? To start with, yes. Many countries have held elections already during the pandemic. Some, like New Zealand, have had relatively few cases of coronavirus to contend with. But others, like the US, have successfully conducted ballots while in the grip of nationwide outbreaks. There have even been a number of council by-elections in Scotland over the past year, from Edinburgh and Aberdeen to the Western Isles. Yes, they featured a far smaller turnout than is expected in May - but they provide vital experience for returning officers in terms of the ease of finding polling places and recruiting staff in the present conditions. The Holyrood election is not the only one due in the UK this spring, either - there are also elections to the Welsh Parliament and a host of local council and mayoralty contests across England. As it stands, everyone is still planning for an election on Thursday 6 May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she can ""see no reason at this stage"" why it should have to be delayed, despite the fact the vaccination programme will still be ongoing come polling day. Any change would be a decision for Holyrood as a whole, rather than the government. However the principal opposition party - the Conservatives - have backed Ms Sturgeon's position. MSPs have introduced contingency plans which would allow the vote to be pushed back by up to six months - either by a vote of parliament, or in the most extreme circumstances via a decree from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh. But the hope is that the combination of the vaccine and the other backup plans that have been put in place will be enough for the vote to go ahead safely. Any delay would likely have implications across the UK, with the races mentioned above in mind - polling and politics guru Prof Sir John Curtice has suggested that a joint approach may ultimately be taken in Cardiff, Edinburgh and London if there are to be any changes. Voting by post is expected to be a big feature of the coming election - but current plans would not allow for everyone to mail in their ballots. It was already a growing trend - 3.6% of the electorate registered for a postal vote in 2003, then 11.2% in 2007, 14.1% in 2011, and 17.7% in 2016 - and surveys suggest more Scots than ever will want to take the socially-distant option to cast their vote in 2021. At present only 17% of the electorate have signed up for a postal ballot, but officials are braced for this to surge to up to 40% once campaigning gets under way - with parties expected to urge their supporters to sign up en masse. The challenge will be what happens if an even greater number than that apply. The deadline for postal registrations has already been brought forward to provide time to process the expected wave of applications. If, say, half of the electorate were to ask for a postal ballot, the Electoral Management Board have voiced fears the election would have to be pushed back in order to get through the paperwork. And they say an all-postal election likely would not be possible until November, such would be the burden of signing up all 4.2m Scottish voters to the system. One contingency plan on the table is to hold polling across more than one day - potentially even with different age groups voting on different days. Several parties - Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems - have voiced cautious support for multi-day polling. However the Election Management Board have stated a preference for voting on a single date, and both the SNP and Tories are behind that position. Another consideration is where votes are cast. For the most part, there are few concerns about polling places becoming the epicentre of new outbreaks - they are highly regulated environments at the best of times, and officials say they would pose no more risk than a supermarket. However, the Electoral Commission have said they might reconsider using schools as polling places, particularly if voting does take place over more than one day, due to the risk of disrupting education still further. Within polling places, more stations where voters can cast their ballot may be set up, to reduce queues - which would require extra staff to be taken on. One final question applies to when votes might be counted. Talks have been held about whether the traditional overnight count - with staff packed into community centres and gym halls - would go ahead as normal, or whether results could be tallied at a more sedate pace the following day. The election campaign is due to officially begin in March - although arguably some parties have already been in campaign mode for some time now. It seems highly unlikely that social distancing guidelines will have been relaxed enough by then for politicians to go out shaking hands and kissing babies. Indeed there have been complaints in some quarters about candidates going out knocking on doors during selection contests, so the traditional ""boots on the ground"" approach will likely take a back seat to the ""air war"" of wider messaging. The US election is likely to be instructive - Joe Biden managed to win the presidency despite rarely leaving the house. One final wrinkle is that this year, MSPs will likely still be MSPs right up to polling day. Normally in an election year, Holyrood would shut down in late March. However this year ""dissolution"" is likely to be delayed until the day before polling, in case parliament needs to be recalled in an emergency. This is mostly a technical matter - Holyrood would be in recess, so members wouldn't be prevented from campaigning - but would mean members were bound by the MSPs code of conduct throughout the election period.",BBC News - UK Politics,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 23:05:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-55545738
QAnon: What is it and where did it come from?," Supporters of the QAnon movement were among the crowd that stormed the US Capitol building on Wednesday. Several prominent activists were spotted inside the building, and others flew Q-themed banners inside and out. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter President Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as ""people who love our country."" So what is QAnon and who believes in it? At its heart, QAnon is a wide-ranging, completely unfounded theory that says that President Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.  QAnon believers have speculated that this fight will lead to a day of reckoning where prominent people such as former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will be arrested and executed.  That's the basic story, but there are so many offshoots, detours and internal debates that the total list of QAnon claims is enormous - and often contradictory. Adherents draw in news events, historical facts and numerology to develop their own far-fetched conclusions.  In October 2017, an anonymous user put a series of posts on the message board 4chan. The user signed off as ""Q"" and claimed to have a level of US security approval known as ""Q clearance"". These messages became known as ""Q drops"" or ""breadcrumbs"", often written in cryptic language peppered with slogans, pledges and pro-Trump themes. Twitter cracks down on QAnon conspiracy theorists Actually, thousands do. The amount of traffic to mainstream social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube has exploded since 2017, and indications are the numbers have gone up further during the coronavirus pandemic. The big social media companies subsequently tightened their rules about QAnon content and took down hundreds of Q-supporting accounts and videos. But social media and opinion polls indicate there are at least hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who believe in at least some of the bizarre theories offered up by QAnon. And its popularity hasn't been diminished by events which would seem to debunk the whole thing. For instance, early Q drops focused on the investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.  QAnon supporters claimed Mr Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 US election was really an elaborate cover story for an investigation into paedophiles. When it concluded with no such bombshell revelation, the attention of the conspiracy theorists drifted elsewhere. True believers contend deliberate misinformation is sown into Q's messages - in their minds making the conspiracy theory impossible to disprove. QAnon supporters drive hashtags and co-ordinate abuse of perceived enemies - the politicians, celebrities and journalists who they believe are covering up for paedophiles. It's not just threatening messages online. Twitter says it took action against QAnon because of the potential for ""offline harm"". Several QAnon believers have been arrested after making threats or taking offline action. In one notable case in 2018, a heavily armed man blocked a bridge over the Hoover Dam. Matthew Wright later pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge.  US conspiracy theory shuts school festival A Pew Research Center study in September 2020 found that nearly half of Americans had heard of QAnon- double the number from six months before. Of those who had heard about it, a fifth had a positive view of the movement. And for many believers, QAnon forms the foundation of their support for President Trump.  Mr Trump has, unwittingly or not, retweeted QAnon supporters, and prior to the election his son Eric Trump posted a QAnon meme on Instagram. How influential is a pro-Trump conspiracy theory? One outspoken QAnon supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, was elected to the US Congress in November.

Covid: Why did Boris Johnson decide to lock down England?," We are used to events moving quickly in this pandemic, but how did we get from Boris Johnson urging parents to send their children back to school, to announcing a strict lockdown for England the next day? This was not the plan. At least not at the start of Monday.  In the space of 36 hours, the government went from urging parents of primary pupils in England to send their children back to school - to shutting classrooms for almost all children for at least seven weeks and telling everyone to stay at home.  So what changed?  On Sunday morning, the prime minister made clear more restrictions were coming in England. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the situation was tough and he believed the public was reconciled to stricter rules.  PM acted 'decisively' on England lockdown - Sunak'From tier 2 to lockdown in a week is depressing' Why did schools reopen for a day and other lockdown questionsWhat are England's new lockdown rules? But there was little in the way of detail of what could be coming. Mr Johnson urged parents to send their children back to schools if they were open. Classrooms, he said, were safe. It was, he insisted, sensible to keep primaries open. It was thought the next step would be putting more areas into tier four - and that some schools could be closed for a while in areas where the virus was spreading fast. But it seemed that a decision could be a couple of days away. A March-style ""stay at home"" lockdown was not being discussed widely.  On Monday morning, in another interview with broadcasters, the PM said the impact of the new tier four was ""a bit unclear"", suggesting the government still wanted time to assess the numbers (remember it was only introduced on 19 December).  There was no sign of the urgency which was to come - Mr Johnson said further restrictions would be announced ""in due course"".  Over the next few hours, the situation developed at a dizzying pace.  A key factor was the UK's four chief medical officers who, around the same time Boris Johnson was being interviewed at a hospital in London for TV, made the decision to move the whole of the UK to the highest Covid alert level.  They drafted a joint statement saying that the NHS was under ""immense pressure"" and that they were not confident it could handle a further sustained rise in cases.  It concluded: ""Without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days"". That put huge pressure on Boris Johnson to act ahead of the release of that statement.  Although the Covid alert level had been forgotten by many, according to the measures revealed in the summer it meant extreme strict social distancing should come back. The BBC revealed the decision a few hours later and it was officially confirmed at 1800 GMT. It was now hard to see how a lockdown could be avoided.  Downing Street has also made it clear the prime minister was influenced by new statistics he was shown on Monday which revealed more than 80,000 people had tested positive in the UK on 29 December - and that the new variant was spreading in all parts of England.  But Boris Johnson decided to act under significant political pressure too.  Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon had met her cabinet on Monday morning - and they had signed off the decision to tell Scots to stay at home and to delay the re-opening of schools.  Ms Sturgeon announced that decision just after 1400 GMT - and said she was now more concerned than she had been at any stage since March. She argued Scotland was four weeks behind parts of the south of England, ramping up pressure for a stronger lockdown there too.  Labour was also calling for a national lockdown in England to be imposed immediately - telling the prime minister he had to clarify what was happening rather than ""hinting"" at further restrictions.   The former health secretary - Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt - added his voice to calls for urgent measures.  In the end, Downing Street announced plans for a televised national address at 1450 GMT - and a few hours later the prime minister revealed the new lockdown. Ministers argue the PM made a decisive decision in the face of ""new information"" about the spread of the virus. Whitehall sources also say the insistence that schools were safe was right - and that closing them is about limiting movement in the community rather than stopping the spread in schools themselves. But the question Boris Johnson has faced on a number of occasions now is: is he prepared to act quickly enough?",BBC News - UK Politics,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 17:04:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55551180
Brexit: Boris Johnson's claims about its benefits fact-checked," Boris Johnson was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr show how ""ordinary voters"" in a place such as Leigh in Greater Manchester (which voted Conservative in the 2019 election) would benefit from Brexit. The prime minister gave several examples, which we will look at in turn. We're not sure which money he's referring to here (we asked the government but it did not clarify this).   A great deal was made in the EU referendum campaign about the contributions to the EU budget that would no longer have to be made after Brexit. The UK was making its regular contributions to the EU budget until the end of 2020 (as the two sides were still in a transition period), so the amount saved since will not be huge. Also, the UK is still paying money to the EU as part of the divorce bill, covering things like spending that the EU committed to while the UK was a member, but has not yet funded - along with contributions to the pensions of EU staff. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects that the UK will be contributing about Â£7.1bn this year, down from last year's contribution of Â£8.2bn. That's an average saving of about Â£3m a day this year - so Â£9m so far. Pulse trawling, which involves the use of an electric current to force fish off the seabed making them easier to catch, was indeed banned in UK waters on 1 January 2021. But France and Belgium - both EU member states - had already outlawed the practice in their territorial waters (which stretch up to 12 nautical miles from the coast). The UK could have done the same when it was still a member of the EU. An EU-wide ban was also passed into law in June 2019 and is due to come into full effect on 1 July 2021. Pulse fishing has become less common over the past few decades in EU waters. There were eight vessels - seven from the Netherlands and one from the UK - using the technique in the UK's Exclusive Economic Zone (which stretches up to 200 nautical miles from the coast) between January 2019 and June 2020, according to ocean conservation charity the Blue Marine Foundation. While the UK was in the EU, it couldn't have banned them from these waters but now it is an independent coastal state, it can. Mr Johnson is likely referring to super trawlers here (as ""hoover trawlers"" isn't a widely recognised term). Again, we asked the government but it did not clarify this. Super trawlers are typically defined as vessels over 100m in length - 25 of them fished in UK waters in 2019, according to Greenpeace.  Most had a Russian or Dutch flag, except one vessel - the Frank Bonefaas - which sails under a British flag but is majority Dutch-owned.  Who really owns UK fishing rights? Now that the UK has left the EU, it can ban super trawlers from fishing in UK waters, but - under the terms of the Brexit trade deal - this rule must apply equally to UK and EU boats.  This is further complicated by a section of the agreement, which secures access to the UK's territorial waters (between 6-12 nautical miles) for any vessel active in those waters between 2012-16. This measure would - in theory - apply to several super trawlers.  The Marine Management Organisation has already granted temporary licences to at least seven super trawlers (six of which are registered in the EU) to continue fishing in UK waters beyond 31 December 2020.  The points-based immigration system did go live at the start of the year as freedom of movement ended for EU citizens (and for UK citizens in the EU).  In future, EU citizens will have to have a certain number of points based on things like skills, to be allowed to work in the UK. There will be some exceptions for people working in areas with labour shortages. You can read more about the points-based immigration system here. This is a claim Mr Johnson has made before - we looked into it in 2019.   Free ports are small free-trade zones, sometimes called special economic zones, in which normal tax and customs rules do not apply. In fact, there are more than 80 free ports in the EU (a point made by Andrew Marr) and the UK had them until 2012.  But they have to comply with EU rules that are designed to ensure fair competition between member states. Supporters of free ports argue that these zones could be more beneficial for the UK once it is outside the EU.  But if the tax benefits given to companies operating inside them are too generous, they could in theory trigger action from the EU, under the terms of the new trade deal. Some trade experts argue that free ports could simply move investment from other parts of the UK.  A government spokesperson said: ""free ports will empower regions across the UK to become hubs for international trade and investment."" CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said four vessels used pulse fishing in UK territorial waters in 2019-2020. They were, in fact, operating in the UK's EEZ.

Covid: Do all tier 3 area workers get 80% of their wages?," The claim: Employees unable to work in tier 3 areas will get a combination of Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit, which will mean they get 80% of their wages. Verdict: While that will be the case for some workers, especially those on very low incomes, some workers will get less than 80% under the new scheme. The prime minister has repeatedly claimed that employees of closed businesses in tier 3 areas will get 80% of their income. This is important because the furlough scheme, which closes at the end of October, made sure such workers received 80% of their wages up to a maximum of Â£2,500. But the Job Support Scheme, which will replace it in November, will provide 67% of normal salary up to a maximum of Â£2,100 a month. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and several MPs have called for the support to be increased to 80%. But Boris Johnson claims that the addition of Universal Credit (UC) means that it is already worth 80%.  ""Combine the Universal Credit with the Job Support Scheme that we've just announced and workers will be getting 80% of their existing salary,"" he said at Prime Minister's Questions on 21 October. Whether a worker gets Universal Credit on top of the job support scheme depends on a number of factors such as the level of their income, whether they have savings and whether they have children. When the prime minister made the claim on 16 October he specified that he was talking about those on low incomes - clearly those on higher incomes will not qualify for Universal Credit and may be above the Â£2,100 a month limit for the Job Support Scheme. It is certainly the case that some workers on low incomes will get at least 80% of their usual wages. In particular, people whose wages were low enough for them to qualify for Universal Credit before their employers were forced to close, are likely to get at least 80% of their wages. But it is also the case that some workers will get less than 80%. We asked the Department for Work and Pensions how the prime minister had reached this figure and were told: ""Those on low incomes getting the full entitlement [of Universal Credit] will receive at least 80% of their normal income."" The DWP said that the full entitlement meant the amount that you would get without reductions for having savings.  The point is that the prime minister failed to mention those who do not get UC at all, or only get a bit of it, who would receive less than 80% of their usual income. An example comes from from the Institute for Fiscal Studies - a single person with no children who owns their own home and earns Â£11,000 a year, would be entitled to a bit of UC if they were put on the Job Support Scheme, but not much, so they would end up on 73% of their usual income. Also, the amount of UC you are eligible for starts reducing once you have Â£6,000 in savings and a worker who has Â£16,000 in savings will not qualify for any UC, regardless of any other factors. So such a worker would not get 80%.

Covid: Eyesight risk warning from lockdown screen time," An eye health charity is recommending people learn the ""20-20-20"" rule to protect their sight, as lockdown has increased people's time using screens.  Fight for Sight advises looking at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes you look at a screen. Out of 2,000 people, half used screens more since Covid struck and a third (38%) of those believed their eyesight had worsened, a survey suggested. Opticians remain open for those who need them, the charity said.  The representative survey of 2,000 adults suggested one in five were less likely to get an eye test now than before the pandemic, for fear of catching or spreading the virus.  Respondents reported difficulty reading, as well as headaches and migraines and poorer night vision. The research charity, which commissioned a survey from polling company YouGov, said it wanted to emphasise the importance of having regular eye tests and to remind people ""the majority of opticians are open for appointments throughout lockdown restrictions"". Fight for Sight chief executive Sherine Krause said: ""More than half of all cases of sight loss are avoidable through early detection and prevention methods. Regular eye tests can often detect symptomless sight-threatening conditions.""  But even simple screen breaks can help to prevent eye strain, the charity suggested. Government guidance states that under lockdown people can leave home for medical appointments and to ""avoid injury, illness or risk of harm"".  The College of Optometrists said its members should continue to provide eye care under lockdown for people who experience any eyesight changes or problems.  Optometrists are the professionals most likely to carry out your eye test when you visit an optician's practice.  Routine appointments can also be provided ""if capacity permits, and if it is in the patients' best interests"", the guidance states.  Screen break advice for children in lockdownNine ways lockdown is different from last time Clinical adviser Paramdeep Bilkhu said the college's own research suggested just under a quarter of people noticed their vision deteriorate during the first lockdown.  ""Our research showed us that many people believe that spending more time in front of screens worsened their vision,"" he said.  ""The good news is that this is unlikely to cause any permanent harm to your vision. However, it is very important that if you feel your vision has deteriorated or if you are experiencing any problems with your eyes, such as them becoming red or painful, you contact your local optometrist by telephone or online."" UK health and safety legislation states employers must pay for eye tests for their employees if they have to use a screen for work for more than one hour a day.  In the summer, the UK Ophthalmology Alliance and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists calculated that at least 10,000 people had missed out on essential eye care in Britain.  In the most extreme cases, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it feared some people were at risk of losing their sight because of a fear of attending hospital during the coronavirus pandemic. A Royal College of Ophthalmologists spokesperson said: ""It is important that people who have found significant changes in their vision seek the advice of an optometrist who will examine, and determine if the changes require further investigation by an ophthalmologist - a medically-trained eye doctor.""",BBC News - Health,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:38:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55620100
"Covid: UK at 'worst point' of pandemic, says Hancock"," The UK is at the ""worst point"" of the pandemic, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned, but said the actions of the public ""could make a difference"". At a No 10 briefing, Mr Hancock pleaded with people to follow the government's Covid rules until the vaccine could provide a ""way out"" of the pandemic. The government earlier published its plan to immunise tens of millions of people by spring. So far 2.3 million people in the UK have had a first Covid vaccine shot. And a total of 2.6 million doses have been given out across the country, with some people having received both doses. Mr Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus was putting the NHS under ""significant pressure"", adding it was ""imperative"" that people limit their social contacts.  ""The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules,"" he said. ""I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don't rule out taking further action if it is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a difference."" The health secretary said he could ""rule out"" tightening restrictions by removing support and childcare bubbles, however. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Laura Kuenssberg: What next for Covid rules?Inside a mass vaccination centrePM criticised over bike ride seven miles from home His comments follow similar warnings from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said that the next few weeks will be ""the worst"" of the pandemic for the NHS. According to the latest figures, there have been another 529 deaths within 28 days of a positive test in the UK, and another 46,169 cases reported. There are also more than 32,000 people in hospital with coronavirus, data shows. Matt Hancock has previously said he's learned to rule nothing out when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.  But today he took the unusual step of doing just that.  Support bubbles and childcare bubbles, hugely valued by so many, will stay.  Senior Whitehall sources have previously told me bubbles were ""untouchable"" but for a minister to say as much, so explicitly and on the record, means there's now very little wriggle room for the government to change its mind. Ministers will know that scrapping bubbles, for those that rely on them, could have proved deeply unpopular. But this certainty is a rarity.  Whilst the current emphasis is on compliance, the idea of toughening up controls in other areas is not being ruled out.  The vaccine delivery plan says it is expected to take until spring to give a first dose to all 32 million people in the UK's priority groups, including everyone over 55 and those who are clinically vulnerable. Under the plan, the government has pledged to carry out at least two million vaccinations in England per week by the end of January, which it says will be made possible by rolling out jabs at 206 hospital sites, 50 vaccination centres and around 1,200 local vaccination sites.  It also reiterates the government's aim of offering vaccinations to around 15 million people in the UK - the over-70s, older care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable - by mid-February. According to Mr Hancock, two fifths of over-80s have now received their first dose, and almost a quarter of care home residents have received theirs. Also at the briefing, NHS England's national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said the NHS was aiming to vaccinate the rest of the top nine priority groups by April, with a final push to offer all adults over 18 a jab by the autumn. He stressed it would take until February before there were ""early signs"" that vaccination was leading to a drop in hospitalisations. The country has still not seen the full impact of the Christmas loosening of lockdown restrictions, Prof Powis added, although he noted there are now 13,000 more Covid patients in hospital than there were on Christmas Day. Speaking in Bristol earlier, Mr Johnson warned the vaccination programme was in a ""race against time"" because of pressure on the NHS. He said it was ""a very perilous moment because everyone can sense the vaccine is coming in - my worry is that will breed false complacency"". When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine?Morrisons to ban shoppers who refuse to wear masks The newly-published vaccination plan also says ministers are aiming to offer jabs at more than 2,700 sites across the UK. And it says that daily vaccination figures for England will be published from now on - showing the total number vaccinated to date, including first and second doses.  Earlier, NHS England's chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, told MPs that there was a ""strong case"" for asking the the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to consider prioritising ""teachers and other key workers"" for vaccination after the ""first nine [priority] groups have been vaccinated"". A quarter of coronavirus admissions to hospital are for people under the age of 55, he added. In the first four weeks of the vaccination campaign, the NHS did 1.3 million vaccinations. News that in the past week almost the same again has been done shows progress is being made - even though there has been some concern rollout to care home residents has been slower than hoped. Hitting two million doses a week is the next target - and is something the NHS is aiming to get close to this week. With more vaccination sites opening by the day, it should be achievable as long as there is good supply. There is already enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all 15 million people in the highest at-risk groups that have been promised an offer of a vaccine by mid-February. However, not all of it has been through the final safety checks or been packaged up ready for distribution. Challenges remain, but even at this early stage it is clear there is growing optimism that the programme is on track.  As seven mass vaccination centres opened across England on Monday, NHS England said hundreds more GP-led and hospital services would also open later this week. But with all centres, people will need to wait until they receive an invitation. Two vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being administered in the UK. On Friday, a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use, although supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. Vaccine programmes are also progressing in the UK's devolved nations.  All over-50s and everyone who is at greater risk from Covid in Wales will be offered a vaccine by spring, under new plans. And Scotland's health secretary has said every aged over 80 or over in the nation will be offered a jab by February, while care workers in Northern Ireland who provide services to ill or elderly patients living at home can now book an appointment to get a Covid-19 vaccine. England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home.  Similar lockdown measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has questioned why there are ""less restrictions in place"" now than there were last March. In his first speech of the year, he said: ""I do think it's time to hear from the scientists [about] what else could be done and that probably should be done in the next few hours"".

And England's Test and Trace scheme has revised one of its definitions of a ""close contact"" - the people who need to be reached if they have been near to someone who has tested positive for Covid. This now refers to anyone who has been within two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes, whether in a single period or cumulatively over the course of one day. Previously the definition was just a single period of at least 15 minutes.

Global health insurance card to replace EHIC under new rules," UK residents can apply for a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) to access emergency medical care in the EU when their current EHIC card runs out. Under a new agreement with the EU, both cards will offer equivalent healthcare protection when people are on holiday, studying or travelling for business. This includes emergency treatment as well as treatment needed for a pre-existing condition. The new GHIC card is free and can be obtained via the official GHIC website. Current European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) are valid as long as they are in date, and can continue to be used when travelling to the EU.  You don't need to apply for a GHIC until your current EHIC expires.  People should apply at least two weeks before they plan to travel to ensure their card arrives on time.  Health Minister Edward Argar said: ""Our deal with the EU ensures the right for our citizens to access necessary healthcare on their holidays and travels to countries in the EU will continue. ""The GHIC is a key element of the UK's future relationship with the EU and will provide certainty and security for all UK residents.""  If a UK resident is travelling without a card, they are still entitled to necessary healthcare, and should contact the NHS Business Services Authority (which covers the whole of the UK), which can arrange for payment should they require treatment when abroad. EHICs from EU member states will continue to be accepted by the NHS. It is advised that anyone travelling overseas, whether to the EU or elsewhere in the world, should take out comprehensive travel insurance.

Covid-19: Southend Hospital oxygen supply reaches 'critical' situation," A hospital's oxygen supply has ""reached a critical situation"" due to rising numbers of Covid-19 infections. A document shared with the BBC showed Southend Hospital has had to reduce the amount it uses to treat patients. It said the target range for oxygen levels that should be in patients' blood had been cut from 92% to a baseline of 88-92%. Hospital managing director, Yvonne Blucher, said it was ""working to manage"" the situation. ""We are experiencing high demand for oxygen because of rising numbers of inpatients with Covid-19 and we are working to manage this,"" she said. ""The public can play their part by staying home and, where they cannot, following the 'hands, face, space' advice to cut the spread of the virus."" 'One in 18 have Covid-19' in parts of Essex Covid-19 and 'the end of normal learning'Husband from couple with Down's syndrome dies In the document, from the Mid and South Essex Hospitals Foundation Trust, which has been shared with frontline NHS staff, the oxygen supply was said to have ""reached a critical situation"". It said it was ""imperative we use oxygen efficiently and safely"" and states patients who are being fed oxygen and have an oxygen saturation of above 92% ""should have their oxygen weaned within the target range"", which is now 88-92%. This means very gradually reducing the saturation level. It added that ""maintaining saturations within this target range is safe and no patient will come to harm as a result"". GPs in Essex have told the BBC that the threshold for sending a patient to hospital for supplemental oxygen is if their oxygen saturation is at 92%. A level of 96-100% is deemed normal. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""huge pressure"" on hospital oxygen stocks because giving patients extra oxygen was a ""key part"" of coronavirus treatment. He said there were a number of hospitals where this happened in the first phase of coronavirus and over the past few weeks ""similar things have happened"" elsewhere. ""This is the kind of problem that chief executives and trust leadership teams are having to solve day in, day out,"" he said. ""If you [a hospital] push your oxygen to an absolutely critical level, then the thing that you can't do is have the oxygen system break down... so effectively you will have to dial it down, in which case you will probably have to transfer patients to the nearest neighbouring hospital for a short period of time.   ""I cannot tell you how much work has been done over the summer and autumn to ensure that people [hospital trusts] have been prepared for this... they knew they would come under pressure if there were to be further waves, as has now proved to be the case."" Essex has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the country, with seven of the 14 council areas in the county in the top 20 most infected areas of England. By Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News Online  News of oxygen issues is understandably worrying, but not unexpected. Tanks may be full, but flow is a problem. Many people who are sick with Covid will need extra oxygen to help them breathe. As Covid admissions increase, it can put huge demand on a hospital's piped oxygen supply system to provide this high flow. Hospital bosses have been planning for such scenarios for months, learning from experiences during the first wave of Covid when some trusts ran into difficulties. Many wards have made improvements to their pipework in preparation for a very busy winter, but there is still a limit to what hospitals can provide. When stretched to the maximum, other steps are needed, such transferring patients elsewhere or limiting how much oxygen is pumped to each patient. Southend Hospital has taken this latter measure. Although not ideal, it is not unsafe. Patients will be closely monitored and the trust hopes the situation will improve if new Covid admissions start to go down as people follow the stay at home lockdown rules.

Covid: The truth behind videos of 'empty' hospitals," Multiple videos posted online claim to show empty hospitals in the UK as evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has been exaggerated.  It has provoked a strong reaction from healthcare officials, who have encouraged the public to heed government advice as coronavirus infections surge - putting pressure on the NHS. Responding to a question about hospital beds being empty, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""When people say that, that is a lie.""   They're mostly filmed by individuals walking through quiet hospital corridors and are being posted in Facebook groups and on the Twitter feeds of coronavirus sceptics and anti-lockdown activists. There have been videos taken of dozens of locations and some have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.  The number of Covid patients has increased significantly in recent weeks and there are serious concerns about the NHS's ability to cope with the surge. However, because of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals, often separating Covid patients from others, and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings will currently look empty.  That doesn't mean hospitals aren't busy. How busy are hospitals in England?Ambulance waiting times in parts of England 'off the scale' We've examined videos from two different locations and sought responses to them from the hospitals. A video posted on social media purports to show an empty Croydon University Hospital, with a commentary claiming that the government is exaggerating the scale of the pandemic.   The video, posted in three parts, has been viewed thousands of times and shared across multiple anonymous social media accounts. It has prompted other users to make comments below the post that their local hospitals are empty too.   Croydon University Hospital is a large centre treating patients on a 24-hour basis.  In a statement in response to the video posts, the hospital trust said: ""Contrary to videos circulating online claiming to show our hospital is empty, our services remain extremely busy.""  The video starts with the camera entering the main reception room through signs saying ""NO ENTRY"".  'Most dangerous time' of the pandemic, says Whitty The main reception area has a closed coffee shop and the person filming says: ""I've never seen this place so empty."" Responding to the footage, a spokesperson for Croydon Health Services told us: ""We have a one-way system in the main entrance to help with social distancing when entering or leaving the hospital. The video shows this person arriving via the exit. ""The video was also filmed overnight, when the coffee shops would be closed and when we would expect to see our corridors less busy,"" they added.   The video shows empty corridors. But there's a good reason the corridors are empty. ""We provide this care in our wards and in other clinical areas - not corridors or waiting rooms,"" said the hospital spokesperson.  The man then walks around the outside of the A&E waiting room. ""Urgent treatment - empty. Look at this place,"" says the individual, filming the outside of a waiting room which looks fairly full of people sitting socially distanced.  ""Regarding the A&E waiting area, the video shows only the entrance to the department,"" said the hospital. ""Patients brought in by ambulance, or those in a serious condition or requiring admission to hospital, are unlikely to be waiting in this area. ""Perpetuating myths and rumours only undermines their [NHS staff] hard work. It also risks the spread of misinformation, which could lead people to risk their own health and the health of their loved ones,"" said the hospital official.  Another set of videos, posted on Twitter but without commentary, shows an individual walking down apparently empty corridors of the Princess Royal Hospital in Bromley on - it's claimed - New Year's Day.  The NHS says the footage ""misrepresents what is really happening"".  Four clips have been uploaded of someone passing down a corridor with a sign for the critical care unit, with a twitter thread referring to ""spare beds"" and the ""closed bereavement unit"" along with the hashtag ""film your hospital"". The videos have been watched tens of thousands of times, but reveal very little about how this particular hospital is dealing with the pandemic. In response, the King's College NHS Trust say the parts of the hospital dealing with the pandemic are extremely busy: ""This corridor is not representative of what is happening in wards across the hospital, which have seen a more than ten-fold increase in Covid admissions in the space of a month."" The bereavement suite, briefly shown in one of the videos, is apparently closed. But according to the Princess Royal University hospital website, it shuts at 4pm and on bank holidays. In a further clip, the person filming the video appears to enter an urgent care centre and on Twitter questions whether it is ""overrun"". The room looks relatively full of people. One particular Facebook group in the UK dedicated to sharing pictures and videos of empty hospitals, had more than 13,000 members.    This group was taken down by Facebook on 8 January. Another similar group subsequently set up was taken down by Facebook on 11 January. The administrators of the original group appear to be linked to another Facebook page promoting a baseless conspiracy about the global Covid pandemic, known as the 'Great Reset' theory. In March last year, several viral videos purported to show empty hospitals across the United States, with the hashtag 'film your hospital' being tweeted by thousands of accounts.  This sparked a trend that has been repeated in other countries.  These videos in the UK are the latest example of people taking direct action to spread misinformation about the pandemic. The year 2020 ended with a group of people standing outside St Thomas' Hospital in London shouting that the pandemic is a ""hoax"".  One doctor witnessed the gathering and posted on Twitter that he was ""disgusted but mostly heartbroken.""

Covid-19: Hancock warns flexing of rules 'could be fatal'," Flexing the coronavirus lockdown rules could be fatal, the health secretary has warned as hospital admissions soar. Matt Hancock did not rule out strengthening current restrictions and told the BBC's Andrew Marr the NHS was under ""very serious pressure"". It comes after almost 55,000 new cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and the number of deaths after a positive test passed 80,000. Scientist Prof Peter Horby warned the UK was in ""the eye of the storm"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the rules were tough but ""may not be tough enough"" and called for the government to hold daily press conferences to avoid ""mixed messages"". The UK recorded another 563 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test on Sunday, down from 1,065 deaths on Saturday. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were also a further 54,940 daily cases. What's still allowed during lockdown?How will the UK vaccinate millions of people?  Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr ""every time you try to flex the rules that could be fatal"" and said staying at home was the ""most important thing we can do collectively as a society"". The health secretary said he did not want to speculate on whether the government would further strengthen restrictions, after warnings from scientists on Saturday that they may need to be stricter.  ""People need to not just follow the letter of the rules but follow the spirit as well and play their part,"" he said. His comments came after Home Secretary Priti Patel defended police over enforcing lockdown rules following the case of two women who were fined for going for a walk five miles from their homes - a decision which is now under review. The government has launched a campaign telling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said that if the virus continued on its current trajectory ""many hospitals will be in real difficulties, and very soon"". In a statement released on Sunday, he said that unless people started to follow the rules more strictly, emergency patients will have to be turned away from hospitals, causing ""avoidable deaths"". Prof Horby, chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said there may be ""early signs that something is beginning to bite"" due to the restrictions - but if they did not then stricter measures would be needed. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I really hope people take this very seriously. It was bad in March, it's much worse now. ""We've seen record numbers across the board, record numbers of cases, record numbers of hospitalisations, record numbers of deaths."" Prof Horby said tougher measures might include those during the March lockdown, such as people only being able to exercise once a day and stricter rules about meeting people. ""We are in a situation where everything that was risky in the past is now more risky,"" he said. Prof Horby said early signs were encouraging that the vaccines would be effective against the new Covid variants - first identified in the UK and in South Africa - and he did not want people to ""hide under the duvet"".  ""We can see the end game now,"" he said. Higher cases inevitably mean more hospitalisations and more deaths.  The most recent figures show that, on average, 894 people per day are now dying within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up from 438 at the start of December.  The spike in cases since Christmas means that figure is almost certain to get worse before the most recent lockdown measures can start to have any effect. Scientists think the new variant of the disease is more ""transmissible"", possibly because each infected individual produces more of the actual virus - sometimes referred to as the viral load.  Vaccination should help to protect the most vulnerable from serious symptoms but we don't yet know if receiving the jab stops an individual contracting the virus and passing it on to others.  Scientists say that may mean even tougher restrictions will be needed to bring the R-number below one and start to reduce the overall size of the pandemic.  Mass community testing is to be rolled out this week, the government has said, and the health secretary said around two million people had been vaccinated in the UK, with some 200,000 jabs being given in England daily. Mr Hancock said by autumn every adult in the UK would be offered a vaccine. He said the government was on course to reach its target of 15 million people vaccinated by mid-February, with the opening of seven mass vaccination centres this week likely to increase the rate of jabs. Mr Hancock told Sky News' Sophy Ridge he hoped coronavirus could be treated like seasonal flu with an annual vaccination programme in the future. Prof Horby said the vaccines may have to be updated ""every few years"" as the virus mutates and said it was unlikely the virus would go away completely. ""We're going to have to live with it,"" he said. ""But that may change significantly.  ""It may well become more of an endemic virus that's with us all the time and may cause some seasonal pressures and some excess deaths but is not causing the huge disruption that we're seeing now.""

NHS Covid-19 jab letters 'confusing over-80s'," People waiting to receive the Covid-19 vaccine say they are confused by NHS letters inviting them to travel to centres miles away from their homes. The first 130,000 letters have been sent to people aged 80 or older who live about 30 to 45 minutes' drive away from one of seven new regional centres. But patients, many of whom are shielding, questioned why they had to travel so far in a pandemic. Local jabs are available to people if they wait, the NHS said. The seven centres include Ashton Gate in Bristol, Epsom racecourse in Surrey, London's Nightingale hospital, Newcastle's Centre for Life, the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre, Robertson House in Stevenage and Birmingham's Millennium Point. People will not miss out on their vaccination if they do not use the letters to make an appointment at one of the centres, the NHS said. Two Labour MPs tweeted about their concerns about the letters being delayed in getting out to people due to coronavirus affecting Royal Mail staff. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Mary McGarry from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire told BBC News that her letter points to an NHS online booking page which suggests she would have to take her husband, who has cancer and a lung disease, 20 miles to Birmingham. ""We're very reluctant to go into Birmingham city centre,"" she said. ""If we can't get somebody to take us, we'd have to go on the train but we're shielding because my husband's got poor health.... we want to know why we've got to travel that far?"" Kay Hayward, from Whitwick in Leicestershire, said she went online to book an appointment for her 85-year-old husband Kenneth and was offered five different places including Widnes in Cheshire and Stevenage in Hertfordshire. ""I thought they must be joking... we talked about it and we thought it was actually safer to stay here and for him not not have it. ""But we were worried if we turned this down, we'd be off the list.. the letter doesn't say anything about having the vaccines anywhere else locally."" Andrea Eaton, from Coventry, said she was so angry that her 81-year-old mother, who has heart problems and leukaemia, was offered Birmingham for her appointment that she attempted to ring Downing Street on Saturday night to complain. She said she reached the press office and said: ""I want you to give Boris a message please that he has lied to the British public. ""He has told them they never need to go more than 10 miles... they were really rude and just put the phone down on me."" A spokesperson from Number 10 told BBC News that they did not wish to comment, but wanted to remind the public to use the government website to write to the prime minister or contact their constituency MP. Councillor Shaun Davies, the Labour leader at Telford and Wrekin Council in Shropshire, said he had been contacted by dozens of people who have found the letters misleading, thinking this is their only chance to get the vaccine. He said he had spoken to Trafford Council and was aware of people in Shropshire being sent to Manchester and residents there being directed to Birmingham to get their jabs. ""For many people they have been told consistently to wait for the NHS to contact you in order to get a vaccine and that's what they've had for the first time as a piece of communication. ""This is really, really concerning for people in their 80s or 90s because of the importance of getting the vaccine."" The letters are not ""going to the heart"" of the public health message which is staying home and staying local, he said. Dr Sarah Raistrick, from Coventry and Rugby Clinical Commission group (CCG), said people did not have to travel to the centres but admitted the letter did not make that clear. ""You can wait and be contacted by your local GP service and have it locally if you'd prefer. ""If you sit tight, you will be contacted and I'm hopeful that if you're 80 or over, by the end of this month you will have had your vaccination whether that is locally or whether you have chosen to travel,"" she said. Work will be done with the NHS locally and nationally to make that message clearer, she added. The seven centres were chosen to give a geographical spread covering as many people as possible and are capable of delivering thousands of jabs per week, NHS England has said. BBC News has contacted NHS England for a response.

Covid-19: Rapid tests for asymptomatic people to be rolled out," Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week, the government has said. The community testing regime - expanded to cover all 317 local authorities - uses rapid lateral flow tests, which can return results in 30 minutes. Local councils are being encouraged to prioritise tests for those who cannot work from home during the lockdown. The health secretary said asymptomatic testing can help break transmission. Meanwhile, NHS England has invited tens of thousands of people over 80 to book vaccinations. Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warn Postcode check: Find out the rules where you liveWhat's still allowed during lockdown? A further 563 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 54,940 cases reported, according to government figures on Sunday. The total number of deaths in the UK after a positive test passed 80,000 on Saturday. The government has launched a campaign telling people to act like they have got the virus in a bid to tackle the rise in infections. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Department of Health and Social Care said expanding the Community Testing Programme to more people without symptoms was ""crucial given that around one in three people"" who contract Covid-19 show no symptoms.  It said regular community testing using the rapid tests had already identified more than 14,800 positive Covid-19 cases. So far, 131 local authorities in England have enrolled in the government's community testing programme, with Milton Keynes, Slough, Doncaster and Essex the latest to join. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said targeted asymptomatic testing and subsequent isolation was ""highly effective in breaking chains of transmission"". But Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol Medical School, said increasing lateral flow testing was ""very worrying"" and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases ""will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests"". Defending lateral flow tests on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Mr Hancock said mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool had seen the case rate drop ""more sharply than it did in other similar areas where only restrictions were brought in"". NHS Test and Trace will also work closely with other government departments to scale up workforce testing, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Many are already piloting regular workforce testing, with 15 large employers having taken up this offer already across 64 sites, ""including organisations operating in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks and the military"". The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place for rapid testing of staff and students in schools and colleges and staff in primary schools. Asked when schools could reopen by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Hancock said there were four conditions: that there is not a major new variant, the vaccine rollout is proceeding effectively, the number of deaths is falling and there is an easing of pressure on the NHS. Businesses have welcomed asymptomatic testing.  Matthew Fell, of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said: ""This expansion of testing will help more critical workers and those unable to work from home to operate safely, while also catching new cases more swiftly."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the safety of the workforce had been an ""absolute priority"" and said the expansion of testing means ""we can keep our economy on the move while giving individuals in key sectors complete confidence that their workplace is safe"".

"Covid: UK reports more than 80,000 deaths"," More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic, official figures have shown. A further 1,035 deaths in the UK were reported on Saturday, taking the total by that measure to 80,868. The number of daily cases of people who tested positive for coronavirus increased by 59,937. Only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico have recorded more Covid deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. It is the fourth day in a row that the UK has reported more than 1,000 daily deaths. It comes as scientists advising the government have warned that lockdown measures in England need to be stricter to achieve the same impact as the March shutdown. Ministers have launched a new campaign urging people to act like they have the virus. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, received Covid-19 vaccinations on Saturday. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you liveWhat's still allowed during lockdown?Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this'Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? The Office for National Statistics recently estimated as many as one in 50 people in England had coronavirus between 27 December and 2 January, while in London it was one in 30.   On Friday, mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of Covid in the capital was ""out of control"". Official figures from Public Health England showed London had the highest regional case rate in the UK, exceeding 1,000 per 100,000 people. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can only go out for essential reasons. Similar measures are in place across most of Scotland, in Wales and Northern Ireland. Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the current rules were ""still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus"".  He said the new variant of Covid was around 50% more infectious compared to the virus that infected people last March. ""That means that if we were to achieve the same result as we got in March we would have to have a stricter lockdown, and it (the current regime) is not stricter,"" he added. The professor of health psychology at University College London also told the BBC more children were going to school, compared to during the first lockdown.  He said schools were ""a very important seed of community infection"". More children are at school, after the Department for Education widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils allowed to attend. Attendance rates have risen to 50% in some places. Prof Susan Michie, who is also a member of Sage, said the spread of the new, more infectious variant meant current restrictions were ""too lax"".  ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said, in comparison to the first lockdown in spring 2020, more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus.  Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's statutory sick pay system was ""not fit for purpose for a pandemic"" and more effective measures to encourage people to isolate were needed.

Moderna becomes third Covid vaccine approved in the UK," Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""excellent news"" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.  It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS.  The UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. It is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published.  There are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future.  Around 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. That figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people?When will you be eligible for a Covid vaccine? Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK.  The prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.  Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease."" The UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible.  In total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19. Nadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: ""The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live. ""The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster."" The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer.  In comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. The AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature. All of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid.  No vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last.  People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others.  EU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine.",BBC News - Health,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 16:33:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55586410
Covid cases 'up almost a third in week after Christmas'," Covid infections rose by almost a third between 26 December and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a day according to a major study. In a different piece of research, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period. Daily infections are understood to have risen to about 150,000 since then.  That would bring daily coronavirus cases above the first peak. The R or reproduction number for the virus is now between 1 and 1.4 for the UK, reflecting the sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. Separate ONS data suggests just under half (44%) of British adults formed a Christmas bubble. These temporary rules let up to three households mix indoors on 25 December - unless they were living in a Tier 4 area. The ONS estimated how much of the population had Covid in the week of 27 December- 2 January: One in 50 in England (up from one in 70)One in 70 in Wales (down from one in 50)One in 200 in Northern Ireland (up from one in 230)One in 115 in Scotland (up from one in 145) The ONS data suggests cases rose by three-quarters between its two most recent study periods: 12-18 December and 27 December - 2 January. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study was able to track more recent changes since there was no pause in its research for Christmas. It found the epidemic is growing throughout the UK. Researchers estimate the virus's reproduction or R number is currently 1.2 across the UK. Both sources indicate London has the most severe epidemic with the highest number of cases.  Confirmed cases, published on the government's dashboard, are always lower than those in surveys because they mainly reflect the test results of people coming in with symptoms. Both the ONS and ZOE also look at asymptomatic cases - people who may not otherwise get tests. Some asymptomatic testing is now available in the community but it is not being widely taken up. About a fifth of people responding to a separate ONS survey looking at the social impacts of the pandemic, said they had found it difficult to follow the Christmas rules. And half of those gave the fact that they had already made plans as the reason. Rules, which were set to allow everyone in the UK to mix in a five-day window, were changed at the last minute, on 19 December.  In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all.  Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

Are Covid patients getting younger?," Since the end of the second lockdown in England, the numbers of people being admitted to hospital with Covid have been rising quickly on a daily basis. Some healthcare staff say they are seeing younger patients, so what does the data show?  There are more people of all ages in hospital with Covid now than in the first wave last spring - that includes the young and old. Infections have been highest in teenagers, students and people in their 20s and 30s in recent months. A small percentage of people from these age groups inevitably end up in hospital needing treatment. But the overall pattern of those at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying has not changed significantly. The older someone is, the greater their risk from Covid-19 - particularly over the age of 65. For people under 40 who are infected, their risk of death is 0.1%. This rises to more than 5% for people over 80, according to Imperial College London research on the first wave. 'How long can we keep going like this? About a week' This is equivalent to the risk of death from Covid doubling approximately every eight years of ageing. Better treatments, greater knowledge of how the disease progresses and the rollout of vaccines should all improve these figures in the second wave. Since the start of the second wave in late September, the highest hospital admission rate for confirmed Covid-19 has been in the over-85s, followed by 75 to 84-year-olds. Children and young adults have consistently seen the lowest rates. Compared with the first wave in the spring, more children and adults in all age groups have been admitted to hospital with the virus, creating pressure on the NHS during an already busy winter. Coronavirus, schools and children - what are the risks?'Significantly' more children with Covid in second wave ""Children's wards are usually busy in winter,"" Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said recently. ""As cases in the community rise, there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only."" Although people in middle age are less affected than the over-65s, they are by no means risk-free. In the last few weeks, for example, adults aged 18-64 have accounted for 40% of daily Covid admissions to hospitals, data from Public Health England shows. This compares to 40% for 65-84 year olds and 20% for the over-85s.  And there has been a steep rise in the numbers of people in their mid-40s to mid-60s becoming seriously ill with Covid and being admitted to intensive care units. There has also been a slight increase among younger adults too, although fewer than one in 100,000 was critically ill with Covid in December. In contrast, children under 17 make up a very small percentage of those admitted to hospital with Covid - around 1% - and it is extremely unlikely they will need intensive care treatment. The ages of people who have died with Covid-19 since June show the huge impact on older age groups and the rarity of a Covid death in the under-30s.  But there have been some during the pandemic. Twenty-seven deaths have occurred among under-19s who tested positive for Covid-19, according to NHS England, and 317 among 20 to 39-year-olds. More than 80% had an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes, which may have increased their risk. Dr Nick Scriven, a former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says he has seen a patient in their 20s requiring oxygen treatment but most were in their mid-40s, 50s and above - and the most seriously ill were over 50. ""They are not very different ages to the first wave,"" he says, although people are surviving for longer and fewer are being put on ventilators. In intensive care, the average age of Covid patients in the second wave is 60.2 compared with 58.8 in the first wave. According to analysis of 10,000 patients in intensive care in the last four months of 2020, men are around twice as likely as women to end up critically ill with Covid, from the age of 40 upwards. While most seriously-ill men in intensive care were in their 60s, around 15% were in their 50s and 8% in their 40s. The new variant, which is thought to be more transmissible than previous forms of the virus, is behind the recent sharp rise in cases. It appears to affect people of all ages - but there is no evidence it makes people more seriously ill with Covid-19, including children and young people.",BBC News - Health,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:12:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55586994
Covid: What happens if hospitals are overwhelmed?," The UK is in lockdown because of fears hospitals could become overwhelmed within weeks. Pressure on the NHS is always difficult in winter because people are more likely to have accidents or get ill at this time of year. But Covid-19 is making the situation much tougher. It's a situation that health services around the world are facing and why governments are taking extra steps to stop the situation arising. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains what an overwhelmed health service would be like and how it can be avoided.

Covid: How busy are hospitals in England?," When announcing the national lockdown, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the NHS risked being overwhelmed if the measures weren't taken. But statistics suggest that the proportion of beds currently occupied by patients is actually lower than usual. So how can both things be true? Winter is normally an incredibly busy time for the NHS, coinciding with the peak of the flu season. This is why we often see new stories at this time of year about patients facing long waits for care and ambulances struggling to get patients into emergency departments. But this year, the system is facing the added pressure of preventing coronavirus spreading between patients while anticipating surges in cases. The changes this year include: Less space for beds due to the need for larger gaps between themThe division of wards into three zones: those for people with coronavirus, those awaiting test results and those who have tested negativeIncreased infection control - including cleaning and putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) - which takes up staff timeIncreased critical care beds and patients, which require more intensive staffing Combined, these factors mean that hospitals have less capacity than usual, meaning fewer beds are available for fewer patients. In total, NHS hospitals in England have about 7,000 fewer available beds than usual. The data shows that hospitals were at about 87% occupancy in December and early January, however this figure increases to just over 90% in London and the South East. This means that for every 10 hospital beds available across England, roughly nine had a patient in them on any given day. This occupancy rate is actually noticeably lower than a usual year. In a normal winter, occupancy tends to average between 93% and 95%. But NHS England warns against using direct comparisons because - as mentioned - you wouldn't exactly be comparing like for like in the way the hospitals are being run.  Effectively, bed occupancy shows how many beds are available should patients need them, but what it doesn't paint a picture of is how much work is needed to tend to these beds. And this year, with increased infection control and the movement of staff to intensive areas, that workload has increased. Even in early December, NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said that already the pressures felt as bad as a normal year despite fewer patients and lower bed occupancy. Does the NHS really need protecting?NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' In theory, there are 12,000 free beds in NHS hospitals in England. But no hospital ever aims to be close to 100% occupancy. Guidance actually recommends that an optimum level is about 85% occupancy. This is to reduce the risk of staff becoming overstretched or being unable to deal with any unexpected surges of patients for whatever reason. The coronavirus has meant that hospital bosses have felt the need to ensure even more wiggle room than usual, because the virus tends to spread quickly. The number of patients in hospital in England with the virus has increased by 8,000 since the start of December, hitting 22,534 on 1 January, a record high. And once the virus is prevalent in a community, it affects hospital staffing as some of them need to take time off due to sickness or self-isolation. During the first wave in April, 6.7% of staff were absent from work, compared with 4% in the previous year. So while hospitals are feeling these increased winter pressures, they need to ensure that they still have that wiggle room. Outside the NHS, the government can work with private hospitals and also look towards the Nightingale hospitals, but this also might be affected by staffing pressures. To create that wiggle room, there has been a big decrease in patients coming in for non-urgent operations and outpatient appointments, to ensure that space is there and pressures are not increased. Even in September 2020, when hospitals were beginning to increase the number of operations carried out, these were still 25% lower than in previous years. This also helps explain why there are also fewer patients in hospitals this year, as well as fewer beds. The impact of this is a large backlog and the potential for certain treatments - such as cancer care - being delayed. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

South Africa coronavirus variant: What is the risk?," A new variant of coronavirus circulating in South Africa is now being seen in other countries, including the UK.  Experts are urgently studying it to understand what risk it poses.  All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, mutate.  These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive.  Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some can make it more infectious or threatening to the host - humans.  There are now many thousands of different versions, or variants, of the pandemic virus circulating. But experts' concerns focus on a small number of these.  One is the South African variant called 501.V2. The South African variant carries a mutation called E484K, among others. It's different to another recently discovered variant that scientists have been studying in the UK. Both the new South African and UK 'Kent' variants appear to be more contagious, which is a problem because tougher restrictions on society may be needed to control the spread.  While changes in the new UK variant are unlikely to harm the effectiveness of current vaccines, there is a chance those in the South African variant may do so to some extent, say scientists.  It is too soon to say for sure, or by how much, until more tests are completed, although it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless.  Scientists have tested the Pfizer Covid vaccine against one of the mutations found in the South African variant, called N501Y, using blood samples from 20 people. In that preliminary study, vaccination appeared to work against the mutated virus.  More studies are needed though, because N501Y is not the only change the South African variant has undergone.  Dr Simon Clarke, who is an expert in cell microbiology at the University of Reading, said: ""The South African variant has a number of additional mutations including changes to some of the virus' spike protein which are concerning."" The spike protein is what coronavirus uses to gain entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are worried about these particular mutations.  ""They cause more extensive alteration of the spike protein than the changes in the Kent variant and may make the virus less susceptible to the immune response triggered by the vaccines,"" said Dr Clarke.  Prof Francois Balloux, from University College London, said: ""The E484K mutation has been shown to reduce antibody recognition. As such, it helps the virus SARS-CoV-2 to bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination."" But even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts. Scientists seek to understand new variant There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of the mutated viruses cause more serious illness.  And measures like washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help stop the spread.  It is already the dominant virus variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.  Other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have also found cases. The UK has detected two people with the South African variant - one in London and the other in the north west of England. Both were contacts of people who travelled to South Africa.  The UK has imposed a ban on direct flights from South Africa and restrictions on flights to the country. Anyone who has travelled there recently, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately.  Public health authorities and scientists are studying the variant and will share their findings soon.  Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser on Covid-19 to Public Health England, said: ""We are carrying out work as a priority to understand the potential risk this variant may cause. It is important to say that there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccine would not protect against it.""",BBC News - Health,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 08:57:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55534727
Coronavirus: Dutch shocked to be EU vaccination stragglers," The Dutch army is cleared to help hospitals, intensive care units borrow beds from other wards, patients are sent to Germany for treatment, routine operations are postponed, a nationwide lockdown is in place - and still no vaccinations. In a proudly well-organised country, with a well-funded health service, the first Dutch nationals will receive their coronavirus jabs on Wednesday - ten days after their European neighbours and nearly a month after the UK.  The Dutch government has come in for stinging criticism. One former public health director, Roel Coutinho, warned the country's ""shameful"" vaccination strategy was ""going to cost lives"".   During an emergency debate in parliament, opposition politicians called the approach ""chaotic and confusing"".  ""Striking mismanagement by government,"" was the assessment of Tim, a doctor in general practice here. ""We've almost had a year to plan ahead, arrange logistics and update software. But it's all coming down to the last moment."" ""Embarrassing,"" lamented Arjen Joosse, a Dutch oncologist. ""Too slow in preparation and wrong choices.""  One of the main delays was caused by an IT system which needed to be upgraded to allow local health authorities to track appointments and check which vaccine each patient has received.  The systemic delays since the start of the pandemic are symptomatic of the Netherlands' bureaucratic health service, set up for efficiency but with many disparate elements making it inflexible. Covid-19 has exposed it as sluggish when required to respond to rapidly shifting realities.  Tim, the Dutch GP (he declined to give his full name), told me: ""We're lacking a crisis commander in what is essentially a war-like situation"". Alan Wouda, a 23-year old student, said the Dutch were ""blinded by our nuchterheid (sobriety) - too stubborn to acknowledge we made mistakes"". Another student, Joelle Hibbel, asked ""is it possible to be baffled and raging with anger at the same time?""  ""That's how I feel about how the Dutch government is handling the pandemic in general and the vaccination process in particular."" The embattled health minister, Hugo de Jonge, said the Dutch were ""prioritising safety"", and suggested some countries like the UK had cut corners to start vaccinating sooner.  The UK gave emergency approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, but the EU's European Medicines Agency took longer to issue a conditional marketing authorisation.  Mr De Jonge initially defended the late start and dismissed criticism by saying ""it's not a competition"". Mass vaccinations will be available in all 25 Dutch local health authority locations by 18 January. The Netherlands assumed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine would be ready for use first. Unlike the Pfizer one, it does not need to be stored at extremely low temperatures and so can be administered more easily by local medics. But that meant the logistics were not in place to distribute the Pfizer/BioNTech drug when it arrived in the Netherlands on 27 December.  Mr De Jonge eventually conceded this week that he could have acted faster.  ""We have proven insufficiently agile to be able to accommodate the changes,"" he said. ""I could have asked the health boards earlier to prepare... because of their knowledge and expertise with large-scale vaccination campaigns.""   With parliamentary elections on 17 March, some parties are keen to appeal to voters anxious about the rapid development of these vaccines.  Rival hashtags like #ikwildieprikniet (I don't want the jab) and #ikwildieprik (I want the jab) have been routinely trending on Twitter.   Neighbours in The Hague have received calling cards stamped with QR codes through their letterboxes, with a link to anti-vaccination propaganda. Activist groups like ""Virus Truth"" have staged regular protests outside parliament.  The leader of the populist Forum for Democracy Party, Thierry Baudet, is among the most staunch and influential sceptics.  He continues to claim in tweets that Covid is hardly worse than the flu. But Covid is five to 25 times more deadly than a seasonal flu infection, despite the ongoing myths. A recent Ipsos survey of 1,000 people in the Netherlands found initial reluctance to receive the vaccine subsiding, with approximately 75% now willing to be immunised.  Read more on the Dutch coronavirus crisis: Rule-resistant Dutch ordered to mask up indoorsCelebs face backlash over Dutch Covid rebellion The Netherlands brought in a relatively relaxed, so-called ""intelligent"" lockdown during the first Covid wave.  But it is now facing record high infection rates and has been forced to introduce stricter measures, some of which it had initially ruled out. Face masks only became mandatory inside public places last month. ""Judge us in six months time"" was among the responses to my report last April that the Dutch were gambling with a high-risk strategy.  As the vaccines roll out, once again the request is: don't judge us yet. The first Dutch person to be inoculated will be Sanna Elkadiri, a 39-year-old care home nurse.  Seventeen of the 124 residents in her institution reportedly died within a month.  Ms Elkadiri will receive the jab in Veghel, one of three locations where vaccination will start on Wednesday. The Dutch health ministry has made an initial 30,000 vaccines available for a select group of healthcare workers.  When asked about the delay, the ministry told the BBC it had been busy upgrading IT systems and training call-centre staff on the scripts to use with people booking their vaccinations.

"Coronavirus, schools and children - what are the risks?"," Most children across the UK are starting the new term learning from home as schools close to the large majority of pupils in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the coming weeks. So what is known about how the virus is transmitted among children and in schools - and will closing them make a difference? Children's risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny - and this hasn't changed since the start of the pandemic, even with a new, more contagious variant of coronavirus circulating in the UK. Despite a clear rise in the numbers of children infected in the second wave, child health experts confirm they are not seeing a substantial rise in Covid-related illnesses in children in hospital.  ""As cases in the community rise there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only,"" says Prof Russell Viner, president of Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. And Dr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease modeller, tells the BBC that ""we are not getting a significant increase in cases in a primary school setting despite this new variant"". One in three people are thought to have no symptoms when infected with the virus. And children appear to have asymptomatic infections at least as often as adults  Among pupils in primary schools, up to the age of 11, evidence shows that there is limited spread of coronavirus. Children of this age don't appear to be the main drivers for passing it on to their friends or to their families at home. Children of secondary school age are different, however - they appear to be more able to pass the virus on.  But there is no evidence that teenagers are more likely to transmit than adults. Schoolchildren and young adults have undoubtedly experienced a much faster rise in infections than other age groups in the second wave - and that may be down to their opportunities to mingle. During England's lockdown in November, for example, schools remained open and operated normally while many other areas of society were closed to anywhere near normal levels of mixing. This is difficult to unpick. When schools are open, there is more spread among school children, particularly those of secondary school age. There have been signs that transmission dips after school holidays, such as half term. But are levels of infection in schools simply reflecting levels of the virus in their local communities? Early data from an ONS survey of 100 schools in England which tested random pupils and staff without symptoms suggests this is the case. It found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for the infection in November, mirroring an estimated 1.2% infection rate in the general population. Sage, the government's scientific advisory group, also recognises the challenge of judging the role of transmission in schools. ""It is difficult to quantify the size of this effect and it remains difficult to quantify the level of transmission taking place specifically within schools compared to other settings,"" they say in their latest paper from December. Since the first national lockdown in the spring, keeping schools open has been a priority for government ministers because of the importance of education.  The advisory group Sage has always said that closing schools was likely to have an impact on the 'R' or reproduction number of the virus, bringing it down slightly. In the Sage minutes from 22 December, the scientific advisers say the ""closure of secondary schools [is] likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools"". And Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, has said there is early evidence from Sage that the closure of primary schools is likely to have a greater effect than the closure of nurseries.   But the longer-term question is how long they could reasonably be closed for and what would happen when they opened again. Dr Shamez Ladhani, the chief investigator of the ONS schools survey and a consultant at Public Health England, says driving down infections in wider society is the best way to keep schools open and safe, adding that closing them would only have a temporary effect on cases. But Sage also says policymakers need to weigh up the benefits and harms of closing schools, including reducing the direct health risks to staff and the negative impact on children's mental health, education, development and wellbeing. Many experts agree this is a difficult balancing act and argue that schools should be last things in society to close and the first things to open up again.  Experts, including Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of Sage, have said that teenagers are seven times more likely than others in a household to bring the infection into a household. This figure comes from a University of Manchester analysis of household transmission risk, which also found that under-16s are much more likely to be the first case in their household than over-17s. The analysis showed that 2-16 year olds are more than twice as likely to pass on the virus within their household compared to people aged 17 and over.  These may have been the statistics that forced the closure of school gates, with the prime minister saying on Monday evening that schools ""may act as vectors for transmission between households"". The latest data indicates that the variant is spreading quickly across all age groups, including children, and is ""hugely"" more transmissible than previous versions. Scientists are looking into this urgently. New variant 'raises R number by up to 0.7'Impact of new variant on children investigated Research by the Office for National Statistics suggests teaching staff have been at no greater risk of infection than other professions working outside the home during the pandemic. But this data only goes up to October and doesn't cover the new variant which could have an impact on transmission in schools, and elsewhere.

Coronavirus: Israel leads vaccine race with 12% given jab," Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up. Israel has a rate of 11.55 vaccination doses per 100 people, followed by Bahrain at 3.49 and the UK at 1.47, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December.  More than 1.8m people have now died of the virus around the world.  The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart.  The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December.  Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree with UK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses. The Oxford vaccine storyHow close is the light at the end of the Covid tunnel?India plans to 'begin Covid vaccination in January' Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. India has meanwhile approved two vaccines for emergency use - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin vaccine, developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Two further vaccines are awaiting approval. The country aims to vaccinate 300 million people by the middle of the year and has been staging drills to prepare for mass distribution. Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable.  It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider.  Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown.  In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday.  The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines. The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine on 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor, just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine.  This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US.  Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: ""I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason."" India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year.  Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use.  Covid-19 has already claimed nearly 150,000 lives in India, with about 10 million people infected - second only to the number infected in the US.

Covid: Student nurse who nearly died returns to work," In April, BBC Wales reported on a student nurse who almost died with Covid-19. In a video of her emotional reunion with her children the then 35-year-old could not walk without a frame. Kate Rimmington spoke to her about what has happened since.  Spending three weeks in a coma on a ventilator fighting the virus put an unexpected brake on Natasha Jenkins' second year of nurse training - but it did not put an end to it.  In April, a video of her returning home and hugging her children Codie, Elise, and Oakley, then aged 16, 12, and six, was viewed worldwide.  It led rock singer Rod Stewart to get in touch with a gift of Â£5,000 to ""help you through the rough times"". Natasha, who had an existing health condition Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), first became ill just before Mother's Day, before being hospitalised in the middle of the night and taken to intensive care. For weeks Natasha's children were looked after by her parents. No-one could say whether the single mum would survive.  ""They told my family it was hour by hour,"" she said in April. She got through the worst and returned home to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, where she faced the task of getting better - and completing her second year of her degree.  The course was put on hold for 12 weeks so her fellow students could get to work helping with the deluge of patients caused by the first wave of coronavirus - but Natasha was able to use this time to start her recovery. She was warned this could take six to 12 months, given she was struggling to walk and suffering crippling fatigue. But the pandemic meant much of her degree tuition went online, so she was able to study in bed - with six-year-old Oakley, who had particularly struggled with her absence, glued to her side for two months.   Incredibly, she managed to pass the second year at the same time as her peers, and is now in her third year and back training at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.  ""I was just so determined and I knew I had to put my all into it,"" the former GP receptionist said. Eight months on, she is not fully recovered, but is much better.  ""I've had loads of follow up. I said to the psychologist, 'I just feel lucky that I'm here'. I count my blessings really. I've really tried to keep a positive mindset.  ""My breathing is still affected, my lungs are a bit distended but it's to be expected after what I went through."" The family got two dogs to accompany Natasha on her walks to improve her breathing and strengthen her legs, and she has finished her physiotherapy.  She still has some problems with her concentration and memory - she is due a neurological check up in the new year - and the virus has affected her knee joints. She also needs a scan on her throat, because doctors think the tracheotomy scar - from the breathing tube that kept her alive - is affecting her voice and ability to clear her throat.   The children are doing ""really well"", but after such a ""rubbish year"" they decided to put the Christmas tree up in October for some early festive cheer - and the gift from Rod Stewart is helping to pay for a holiday abroad for them all next year.  She was ""gobsmacked"" at his generosity, which had followed ""amazing"" support from her family and friends, and acts of kindness from strangers who left hampers, flowers and chocolates on her doorstep.  For now her goal is to qualify. She is currently working on a surgical ward on half shifts spread across the week while she builds her stamina back up, and again has had ""amazing"" help from her colleagues there.  She hopes she will be able to manage the full 12-and-a-half hour shifts by May. She said: ""The ITU consultant said 'We don't know if you could get it again. You might have a worse dose.' ""But I've dealt with it. I'm not feeling anxious. The ward staff have been more worried than me. ""I thought either I go back and front it, or waste all my training.""",BBC News - Health,"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 00:11:14 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55333420
Coronavirus: Fresh air 'forgotten weapon' in fight," For one GP, the very thought of people keeping windows tight shut ""makes his head explode with anger"". And a leading engineer says he embarrasses his family in restaurants ""by going around trying to bring in fresh air"".   They are part of a growing band of medics and experts worried about how the coronavirus can accumulate in stuffy rooms.  And with people gathering indoors in the winter months, they say the authorities need to emphasise the importance of outside air. How to keep the virus at bay this ChristmasWhat are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? According to the GP, Eilir Hughes, who runs a surgery in north Wales, the government slogan ""hands, space, face"" doesn't go far enough.  It appears on the lectern used by Boris Johnson in Downing Street briefings which gives it massive prominence. But Dr Hughes - who has become known as ""Dr Fresh Air"" for his campaigning on the issue - believes it should say ""hands, space, face, replace"".  He says replacing stale air in a room with fresh air from outside can massively reduce the chances of people becoming infected.  The council in Anglesey is believed to be the first in the UK to display banners spelling out the four-word slogan. Dr Hughes says the new message has attracted attention around the world. ""I say to people: 'Give the gift of fresh air this Christmas.'"" At the start of the pandemic, the authorities focused on what were assumed to be the most likely routes of infection.  One is the risk of touching a contaminated surface - hence the longstanding guidance to keep washing your hands. The other is being hit by droplets produced when someone nearby coughs or sneezes - that led first to the 2m rule for social distancing and later to face coverings.  But the possibility of a third route of transmission - through tiny virus particles known as aerosols lingering in the air - is now widely accepted as well.  It was recognised by advisers to the UK government earlier this year, and then by the World Health Organization.  In the past few days, the US authorities have gone further by saying that inhalation of droplets and aerosols is ""thought to be the main way the virus spreads"". And faced with that risk, handwashing, social distancing and mask wearing are no guarantee of defence.  Shaun Fitzgerald is convinced they do, and he has made it a personal mission to improve ventilation wherever he can.  He is a Royal Academy of Engineering professor at Cambridge University, but that doesn't stop him from ""trying to wrench open windows that have been painted shut or haven't been maintained for years"". ""I have to walk out if I can't open them - I refuse to be in a place that is not well-ventilated."" According to Dr Fitzgerald, the research shows that bringing in a good supply of fresh air to dilute and disperse the virus can cut the risk of infection by 70-80%.  He supports the messaging on handwashing, social distancing and face coverings, but says fresh air ""is always the fourth on the list or often not there at all"". ""My concern is that winter cold hasn't hit us round the face yet, but already this season means people are indoors and windows are usually shut.  ""My very grave concern is that with the new strain of the virus, we know that keeping aerosols down to a low level is going to be even more important, and that means keeping places adequately ventilated."" Dr Fitzgerald points to recent research in a restaurant in South Korea which highlighted how far the virus can spread indoors. With the help of contact tracing and CCTV, scientists were able to establish how one diner was able to infect two others even though one was more than 4m away and the other more than 6m away.  Even though all three were only in the same room for a matter of minutes, that was long enough for the air conditioning to drive the virus over those long distances.  ""Aerosols can travel many metres once they're airborne,"" Dr Fitzgerald says.  ""Two metres doesn't buy you safety, the only thing that does is good ventilation. If they'd opened the windows in that restaurant, that might well have changed things.""  Dr Fitzgerald says it is not about throwing every window open wide all day, but making sure there's enough of a crack to let in fresh air.  And the answer is to add another layer. ""I'd recommend wearing a woolly jumper rather than just a short-sleeved top. ""But that's what we should be doing anyway, to save on heating bills and reduce our energy demand as we all do our bit to tackle climate change."" Dr Hughes says airing rooms for a few minutes several times a day won't lose much heat but will keep people safer. And his idea for a Christmas gift? Thermal underwear.

Covid: Twelve charts on how Covid changed our lives," Life has changed dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There has been an enormous human and financial cost - and its impact has also been felt in many other ways. Four of our correspondents look at the impact of the pandemic in numbers - from cancelled operations to school days lost and a rises in benefit claimants. The most obvious way to measure the impact of coronavirus is to see how many people have died - and look at how much that figure is above the usual annual total.  Between March and the end of November, there were more than 79,000 excess deaths above the five-year average, which were almost exclusively driven by Covid.  Not every death linked to Covid is a death that was directly caused by it. But Office for National Statistics analysis shows close to nine in 10 cases in England and Wales have been. And deaths among younger age groups have been relatively rare - the majority of people who have died have been among older age groups. The average age of death is over 80.  How deadly is the coronavirus?Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?  Neither have deaths been evenly distributed across the country.   London saw a surge in cases first, followed by the north of England, with leaders there suggesting that the first lockdown was lifted too early for them. Now, there are signs the south of England's second wave is growing as the North's recedes. But slice this data up even further and distinct patterns emerge. People from poorer backgrounds and those from ethnic minorities are both at a significantly higher risk of death. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus?Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier?  There are several complex factors at play, with people from these communities more likely to: Work in jobs where they see the publicLive in densely-populated housingHave poorer health, with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and respiratory problems all more common  Covid has also disrupted other NHS services, with warnings about people not getting treatment or diagnosis for other conditions. Routine work, including knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the spring, leading to a growing backlog and more people facing long waits.  Cancer services were severely disrupted and activity levels have only recently returned to normal. Macmillan Cancer Support estimates there may be as many as 50,000 missing diagnoses.  And visits to A&E have also fallen by a third since March, compared with the same time last year. Doctors say people were worried about the Covid risk and felt they should not bother the health service. But among those not coming forward were people with the symptoms of heart attacks and minor strokes.  A year ago, nobody would have thought police would be telling people sunbathing it is against the law, or that ""mingling"" could be punished with an immediate fine of Â£200. But one of Covid's greatest costs has been the unprecedented restrictions on civil liberties in peacetime.  Across the four nations, in the rush to enforce lockdowns and other restrictions, more than 20 pieces of law have come into force that have criminalised otherwise normal behaviour. Most of them were not even debated or voted on by elected politicians. The 27,000 fines, mostly for gatherings, are not evenly spread geographically.  Leicester has been under the longest-standing restrictions - yet it has a far lower rate of fines than north-west England which has faced similar challenges.  Some of that is down to local policing decisions - not least because many officers are very wary of the long-term impact on community relations if they continually dish out fines.  The backlog in the courts is enormous. So much so that there are people now waiting for trial in England, for alleged offences committed in 2018, who may not face a jury until 2022.  When the pandemic hit, jury trials were stopped because the courts could not guarantee safe distancing to prevent the risk of the virus spreading.  Crest, a crime and justice consultancy, estimates that unless capacity doubles, the backlog of crown court cases, the most serious ones, will be near 200,000 by 2024. The Lord Chief Justice hopes to have 300 crown courts sitting by the new year - but that will still be less than the maximum possible.    But these enormous delays to justice - affecting defendants, victims and witnesses - are not just down to Covid. England and Wales already had an enormous case backlog because the government had cut the number of days judges could sit.  The Ministry of Justice says it is funding 40 additional court rooms - dubbed Nightingale Courts - to help tackle the impact of Covid to family, civil and criminal cases. Schools act as a place of safety and routine for children, providing a structure and certainty to their lives. That has been turned upside down in 2020, with schooling closed then repeatedly interrupted by self-isolation in the autumn term.   The headline national figures for secondary attendance have declined, but they don't capture the huge geographical variations in England.   In mid-October it fell to 61% in Knowsley on Merseyside, and in early December in Kent's Medway towns, only 42% of pupils were learning in the classroom at one point.   The loss of learning and confidence is hard to capture, but will ripple through the education system for many years.  Good mental health is vital for children and young people to flourish, but NHS research suggests that during the pandemic it has worsened in England.   Both boys and girls were affected, suggesting the uncertainty, loneliness and disruption of this year have taken their toll.    The pressure on families worried about their finances, forced to spend time together in lockdown appear to be a factor. Teenage girls reporting mental health difficulties are more likely to have seen an argument at home.   More than half a million additional households with children are claiming universal credit than at the pandemic's start, which is a marker of increased child poverty risks.  Schools are reporting a big increase in parents seeking free school meals for their children, although official statistics will not be available until next year.  Food poverty and the corrosive impact on children's lives has galvanised schools to organise food banks and grocery deliveries for families in their communities.   The shame and stigma around children's hunger has been softened by the high-profile campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford. The concern led to government support in the form of extending holiday free school meals, extra payments to families living in poverty, or money to local authorities. Who will get free school meals?How many children need free meals? The welfare system has seen unprecedented demands this year, and 5.7 million people are now receiving the main benefit, universal credit. This figure has almost doubled since March.   It has coped admirably with the surge in claimants, including handling 1.5 million applications over a four-week period to 9 April.  What is universal credit and what else can I claim?Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? It hasn't just processed those claims, it has also increased the speed and accuracy of payments to claimants, and there is understandable pride within the Department for Work and Pensions at what they've achieved.   In total, around 6.3% of people in the UK are claiming unemployment welfare, with fears that this will increase moving forward.  The largest proportion of people on unemployment benefits remain in areas like the north of England, south Wales and central Scotland. But the pandemic has forced people elsewhere who had never previously needed benefits, to turn to the welfare state.   The largest increase in claimants has been in the south of England, which is partly explained by so few claiming unemployment welfare before, making any increases particularly noticeable.   When large-scale working from home started. the cleaners, coffee shops, tailors, and dry cleaners used by London's office workers had no work and needed help, through welfare or the furlough scheme.  The collapse of the aviation sector saw Gatwick's workforce lose jobs and money.  Add in towns with a strong retail economy, like Guildford, and you can see how coronavirus has wreaked economic havoc in the region. As with children, studies have shown that mental health amongst adults has worsened considerably during 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Covid: What could 'tougher' measures mean for us?," The prime minister has said that tougher measures could be needed to help cope with a surge in coronavirus cases. He has not yet said whether we will need school closures, or even overnight curfews like those imposed in France. But clues about such measures to tackle the new more infectious variant come from the government's Sage advisory committee.  The headline is that whether we see a return to only being allowed one form of daily outdoor exercise, or stricter controls on travel around the country, we'll be hearing a lot more about something already very familiar: hand hygiene, social distancing, wearing masks and ensuring there is fresh air. These may sound familiar but the advisers believe that because the new variant spreads so easily, the measures need to be applied with ""a step change in rigour"" - in other words, a lot more forcefully. They suggest considering a return to the two-metre rule because it's more effective than the one-metre plus guidance adopted last year. Masks need to be made of three layers, not just one, and worn in more locations than now - including workplaces, schools and crowded outdoor spaces. The key message is that it is vital to reduce social contact - being close to people, especially indoors for long periods of time, carries the highest risk of infection. So expect tier four-type bans on visiting other households to become normal. The advisers also say many people still do not recognise the key symptoms of Covid-19 - so ministers need to spell them out and help people understand why they should self-isolate. But they also say it is essential to praise the efforts made so far, to recognise sacrifices and emphasise how they've kept infection numbers lower than they would otherwise have been.  Covid rules 'probably going to get tougher' - PMJohnson: Send children to school on MondayUK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday Whatever new measures are picked, the advice to ministers is to offer ""clear and convincing explanations"" to motivate people.

Coronavirus variants and mutations: The science explained," The rapid spread of coronavirus variants has put the world on alert and triggered a new lockdown in the UK. What are these variants and why are they causing concern? All viruses naturally mutate over time, and Sars-CoV-2 is no exception. Since the virus was first identified a year ago, thousands of mutations have arisen. The vast majority of mutations are ""passengers"" and will have little impact, says Dr Lucy van Dorp, an expert in the evolution of pathogens at University College London. ""They don't change the behaviour of the virus, they are just carried along."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Are mutations making coronavirus more infectious? But every once in a while, a virus strikes lucky by mutating in a way that helps it survive and reproduce. ""Viruses carrying these mutations can then increase in frequency due to natural selection, given the right epidemiological settings,"" Dr van Dorp says. This is what seems to be happening with the variant that has spread across the UK, known as 202012/01, and a similar, but different variant, recently identified in South Africa (501.V2). There is no evidence so far that either causes more severe disease, but the worry is that health systems will be overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases. In a rapid risk assessment of these ""variants of concern"", the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said they place increased pressure on health systems. ""Although there is no information that infections with these strains are more severe, due to increased transmissibility, the impact of Covid-19 disease in terms of hospitalisations and deaths is assessed as high, particularly for those in older age groups or with co-morbidities,"" the EU agency said. The variants have different origins but share a mutation in a gene that encodes the spike protein, which the virus uses to latch on to and enter human cells. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? UK has two cases of variant found in South Africa  Scientists think this could be why they appear more infectious. ""The UK and South African virus variants have changes in the spike gene consistent with the possibility that they are more infectious,"" says Prof Lawrence Young at the University of Warwick. But as Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, points out, it's the combination of what the virus is doing and what we're doing that determines how fast it spreads. ""With the new variant, the situation changes more quickly as restrictions are relaxed and tightened, and there is less room for error in controlling the spread,"" he says.  ""We don't have any evidence, however, that the new variant can fundamentally evade masks, social distancing, or the other interventions - we just need to apply them more strictly."" With vaccine roll-out underway, scientists are racing to understand the repercussions for vaccines, which are based on the spike protein sequence. There is particular concern about the South Africa variant, which has several changes in the spike (S) protein.  Most experts think vaccines will still be effective, at least in the short term. Dr Julian W Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, says vaccines can be modified to be ""more close-fitting and effective against this variant in a few months"".  ""Meanwhile, most of us believe that the existing vaccines are likely to work to some extent to reduce infection/ transmission rates and severe disease against both the UK and South African variants - as the various mutations have not altered the S protein shape that the current vaccine-induced antibodies will not bind at all."" Scientists are carrying out laboratory studies to find out more about the variants. And they are tracking every move of the virus as it hopscotches around the world. By taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the virus can be extracted and amplified before being ""read"" using a sequencer. The string of letters, or nucleotides, allows genomes and mutations to be compared. ""It is thanks to these efforts, and UK testing laboratories, that the UK variant has been flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern,"" Dr van Dorp says. Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, says that, through the efforts of scientists to sequence the virus, ""we've got a really good handle on variants that emerge"". In the short-term, only the harshest of lockdowns will reduce case numbers, he says. ""What lockdown does is reduce the number of people with the virus and reduce the amount of virus out there and that's a good thing."" But in the long term, Prof Hiscox suspects, we may face a scenario like flu, where new vaccines are developed and administered every year. ""The problem is, the more variants we get, the greater the chance the virus will be able to escape part of the vaccine - and this may reduce [its] efficacy,"" he says.

Covid-19: The Philippines and its lockdown baby boom," Rovelie Zabala is heavily pregnant with her 10th child. As we talk, the 41-year-old leans at an awkward angle, leveraging all her back strength to hold her ninth child in her arms. ""Carl, Jewel, Joyceâ¦"" As Rovelie names her children, six-year-old Charlie shoots his mother a look of disapproval. ""Sorry, his name is Charlie,"" says Rovelie, innocently. Rovelie had had seven children before she learnt about family planning, but this latest addition was a surprise conceived during one of the world's strictest lockdowns, which saw soldiers patrolling the streets in armoured personnel carriers, police checkpoints restricting movement and only one family member allowed out to shop for food supplies. The lockdown also meant hundreds of thousands of women have been unable to access birth control, resulting in tales of unplanned pregnancies like Rovelie's being repeated across the country. Indeed, it is estimated an extra 214,000 unplanned babies will be born in the next year, according to projections by the University of the Philippines Population Institute and the United Nations Population Fund. These children will be born into hospitals already overwhelmed by 1.7 million births a year, largely into families struggling to make ends meet. And this is only the start. Because the pandemic isn't the only reason why the Philippines has a population crisis on its hands - a closer look reveals a problem years in the making. The Philippine capital Manila is a city bursting at the seams, with 13 million people wedged between Manila Bay and the Sierra Madre mountain range. On average, more than 70,000 people are squeezed into every square kilometre, according to data from 2015. The crush can be felt everywhere from the city's traffic jams to the jails, where people sleep like sardines in cells that are 300% over capacity. And it is the poor who live in the most overcrowded areas, where some are reduced to eating meat raided from rubbish dumps. Experts argue that some of that poverty is directly attributable to the country's high birth rate, as research has shown a fertility rate of close to two children per mother, so that the population is neither growing nor shrinking, boosts a country's development by reducing the number of people born into poverty. In turn, a trimmed-down population receives a bigger slice of the national budget, improving sustainable resource use and life opportunities for all. The Philippine government also knows this. Since the 1960s, it has worked to bring its fertility rate down with some success. So, while the population may have nearly tripled from 35 million to 110 million today, the rate has fallen from 6.4 in 1969 to 2.75 in 2020. Yet they have been far less successful than fellow south-east Asian nation Thailand in the same period. The Buddhist country brought its fertility rate down from 5.8 children per mother in the late 1960s to 1.5 in 2020, according to UN data.  Its poverty rate now stands at 10%, compared to the Philippines' 17%. But why the difference? In part, the Philippines' highly influential Catholic Church, which has led the charge in opposing contraception, encouraging procreation with the verse: ""Be fruitful, and multiply."" ""Of course we are going to oppose it [contraception],"" Father Jerome Secillano, of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, tells me by video call.  ""It is part of mandate not to allow these so-called reproductive pillsâ¦ the so-called 'moral suasion' is just there to remind the people about the moral impacts, the negative impacts it will have on us. But then if the people will not adhere to our call, then so be it."" Despite the Church's misgivings, the Philippines had been getting a handle on things, with Ernesto Pernia, President Rodrigo Duterte's former socio-economic minister, arguing that recent poverty reduction gains can be directly attributed to the government's stronger implementation of the 2012 Reproductive Health Law (RHL), which made sex education and contraception more freely available to the poor. Covid, however, could wipe those hard-won gains out. ""We will lose the entire four years that we have been working on the programme,"" says Juan Antonio Perez, executive director of Commission on Population and Development (POPCOM). ""We will have more unplanned pregnancies, right now it's a rate of three out of every 10 are unplanned, it could be as high as probably half of the pregnancies next year unplanned, in the worst-case scenarios."" Staff at Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Medical Hospital are used to being busy. Back in 2012 the hospital delivered up to 120 babies a day, leading to the ageing, US-colonial-era maternity ward being dubbed ""The Baby Factory"". Things had improved, with the number falling to roughly half that since RHL was approved in 2012. But now they are readying themselves for the ""baby boom"". As we enter 'Ward One', we're hit by a cacophony of crying babies. The room, the size of half a football pitch, has neat rows of single, metal-frame beds, pushed together in pairs. Fans whir away, barely making a dent on the hot and humid conditions. Mothers, adorned in delivery gowns, facemasks and face shields, sit cradling their newborns. ""Right now, you only have only around three or four patients in two beds put together,"" Dr Diana Cajipe tells us. ""Unfortunately we have no space, still so many more patients will come. It's already way above the maximum capacity of the hospital. It can reach six to seven in two beds put together."" The virus is not just causing a numbers problem though: last month the hospital had to temporarily close after seven of the residents and a nurse tested positive.  At such close quarters, it is not hard to see how quickly the virus would travel. The hospital management are hoping a new building will provide more bed space, but, as yet, it is still unfinished. There is no doubt in Mr Pernia's eyes that the long-term cost of the baby boom will be even more ""intergenerational poverty"": the poor giving birth to children the system simply can't handle. But Covid-19 has also put a huge strain on an already stretched national budget, which will cause further problems.  ""I was saying we need at least 2bn pesos ($41.5m) a year to really fully implement the population programme,"" says Mr Pernia. ""But the budget given to the population commission is about half a billion pesos ($10.4m) almost, about a quarter of what is needed.""  President Duterte is a keen advocate of family planning, Mr Pernia says, but is ""more focused on the drugs and the corruption"", alluding in part to a bloody, violent crackdown on drug users and dealers.  The RHL has also had to face down lawsuits from charities allied to the Catholic Church, resulting in the morning after pill remaining illegal and family planning measures being denied to minors unless they have parental consent.  It is notable that the Philippines has the second highest teen pregnancy rate in South East Asia. The pandemic, POPCOM warns, could see that figure rise 20%. The Catholic Church denies the claims levelled against it, urging the government to do more to address the country's rich-poor divide. ""It's always good for these heretics to blame the church for the failures of this so-called reproductive health system,"" says Father Jerome Secillano. ""With the situation we have right now, what will condoms do to the people who are mired in poverty? What will these pills do to the people who are hungry? It is a matter of prioritising what people really need right now."" Rovelie knows nothing but the poverty these men talk about. She lives in Baseco, Tondo, one of the world's most densely populated areas.  But she also knows the Catholic Church, and its teachings on contraception and abortion. ""When I was just pregnant for only a month, I told my partner that I want to abort it because life is difficult,"" she admits to us as we sit on the flood plain of a fetid river, one of the few areas you can find some peace in this bustling community.  ""But he said that we can get through it. I continued rather than committing a sin. ""It's been almost three months since we separated."" Wiping away tears, Rovelie says she's concerned about her children's prospects. As we speak, people scatter as a police patrol car bumps along a muddy road, looking for a drug dealer. Selling drugs, Rovelie points out, is one of the only ways to ""escape"". Now the Covid-19 pandemic has driven the Philippine economy into recession, opportunities here are bleaker than ever.  ""That's my number one worry, if I can still support their education?"" says Rovelie. ""Sometimes when I get angry and lose my temper, I tell them what if I just put them up for adoption for rich people so that they'll be able to have proper schooling. But then I tell myself that I can probably manage.""",BBC News - Health,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:12:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55299912
Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible?," The NHS has begun the biggest mass vaccination campaign in its history to protect people against Covid-19. So far, three vaccines have been approved for use in the UK. More than 1.5 million people in the UK have now been vaccinated - the large majority with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which was approved in early December. A vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca is now also being rolled out in the UK, and the Moderna vaccine has just been approved. Broadly, vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 25 million people in the UK. They are thought to represent 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19. Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers80-year-olds and over and frontline health and social care workers75-year-olds and over70-year-olds and over and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals65-year-olds and over16- to 64-year-olds with serious underlying health conditions 60-year-olds and over55-year-olds and over50-year-olds and over People aged over 80 in hospital, frontline health staff and care home workers have been the first to get the Pfizer jab at designated hospitals hubs and community sites across the UK.  The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is better suited to protecting people who are housebound and in care homes because it's easier to store and transport. It is now being made available at hundreds of GP surgeries and community sites. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? How effective is the Oxford vaccine?Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? The aim is to: vaccinate every care home resident by the end of Januaryeveryone over 70 and anyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable by mid-Februarythe rest of the priority groups after that, possibly by May The second phase of vaccination will focus on the rest of the population, mainly the under-50s, who are much less likely to be ill with Covid-19. Teachers, transport workers and the military could be prioritised at that point, but more data on how well the vaccines are working will be needed before that decision is made. All the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection. Initially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose. But when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the new priority would be to give as many people a good level of protection with the first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses to a smaller number of people in as short a time as possible. Everyone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first.  The US regulator and some UK experts have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision that will protect more people. The official guidance states that every person should get the same vaccine for both doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines - if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa."" However, in the very rare circumstance in which only one vaccine is available at a vaccination site or it's unknown which product an individual received for their first dose, PHE says a different vaccine could be administered.  But this advice does stress ""this option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again"".  ""There may be extremely rare occasions where the same vaccine is not available, or where it is not known what vaccine the patient received,"" Dr Ramsay said. ""Every effort should be made to give them the same vaccine, but where this is not possible it is better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all."" More than 1.5 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. There were 530,000 doses of the Oxford jab and a similar number of Pfizer ones available last week. More will be ready to go this week with the aim to reach two million vaccinations a week very soon. In total, the UK has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 30 million of the Pfizer vaccine, which will be shared out fairly among the four nations. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine are expected in the spring. They will be delivered in batches over the coming weeks and months once they have been quality checked by the regulator, the MHRA. You'll be invited to book an appointment to get a vaccine as soon as it's your turn, probably by phone or letter. Vaccinations will take place: in hospital hubs for NHS staff, care staff and older patientsin thousands of GP surgeries to the over-80s initiallyin care homes to workers and residentsin sports stadiums and conference centres acting as major vaccination hubs for priority groups initially Around 1,000 vaccination sites are currently in operation, including hospitals and GP surgeries, with each local area having a designated site. Some community pharmacies will also be offering vaccinations from next week, but only if they have the staff and storage facilities to be able to do so. The NHS is recruiting 30,000 volunteers to help with the rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff and students - who will be trained to give the jabs. The eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 18 receive a Covid-19 vaccine.  It won't be compulsory, though - no other vaccines in the UK are - as experts say this wouldn't help create confidence in the vaccine. The government has so far ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 367 million doses. If everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK. What you need to know about vaccine safety Experts have concluded that both vaccines are very effective, and have not stipulated a preference for either one in any specific population. Anyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine should not receive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can now have the vaccine.  A severe allergic reaction - known as anaphylaxis - is a very rare side-effect with any vaccine, but it can happen in those at risk. Most people, however, will not be affected in any way. The medical regulator, the MHRA, says anyone due to receive their vaccine should discuss any medical history of serious allergies with their healthcare professional beforehand. Vaccination with either vaccine should only be considered for pregnant women when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks - for instance where the risk of exposure to coronavirus is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying health conditions that put her at high risk of complications of Covid-19. Women should discuss the benefits and risks of having the vaccine with their healthcare professional and reach a joint decision based on individual circumstances.  Women who are breastfeeding can be given the vaccine.  There are no specific safety concerns with the vaccines - but they were not tested on pregnant women during the trials. Pregnant women are likely to be low down the list of priority groups because of their age, and may only be offered a vaccine in the second phase in 2021. No - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS. You can't jump the queue by paying for it, but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round. If you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab. Having both illnesses at once this winter could be dangerous.  At its last meeting, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.

Covid: What are the lockdown rules across the UK?," People should avoid unnecessary contact and stick to lockdown rules, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty has said.  The surge in coronavirus cases ""is everybody's problem"", he argued. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all introduced lockdowns. People in England must stay at home and only go out for certain reasons.  It is illegal to leave home with a ""reasonable excuse"". If you don't have one, police can fine you Â£200 for a first offence - doubling for further offences up to a maximum of Â£6,400. You are not allowed to leave home to meet people socially if you don't live together, or have a support bubble with them. What's a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home? Shopping for essentials such as food and medicine Meeting your support or childcare bubbleChildren can move between separated parentsWorking or volunteering where it is ""unreasonable"" to work from home. This includes work in someone else's home - for example nannies, cleaners and tradespeopleEducation, training, childcare, medical appointments and emergencies Religious worship Moving house Exercise outdoors once a day is also a ""reasonable excuse"" for leaving home. You can exercise with other person from another household in an open public space. You should stay two metres apart from each other.  If you do leave home for one of these reasons, you should stay local - unless it is necessary to go further, for example to go to work.  ""Stay local means remaining in the village, town, or part of the city where you live,"" government guidance says. Travel - internationally or around the UK - is only allowed if it is essential. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential. You should not attend work. Hospitality businesses such as pubs and restaurants and non-essential shops have closed, as have indoor and outdoor sports facilities including gyms and tennis courts. Essential businesses and services can stay open - including: Supermarkets, food shops, pharmacies and garden centresPlaces of worshipPetrol stations and MOT servicesLaundrettesBanks and post officesDoctors and dentists' surgeries and vetsCar parks, public toilets and playgrounds Read England's official guidance. Scotland has its own restriction levels - from zero to four. Mainland Scotland (and the isles of Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha) have moved to ""enhanced level four"" until at least the end of January.  Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities remain in level three. ""Enhanced"" level four rules Nursery, primary and secondary schools close to all but vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers until February - learning moves onlinePeople should only leave home for essential reasons such as caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise or seeing their extended householdThose who are shielding should not go into work, even if they cannot work from homeA maximum of two people from up to two households can meet outdoors (under-11s are not included in the limit and can play together outside)Places of worship are closed except for weddings (up to five people) and funeral services (up to 20 people) - wakes are not allowed.The definition of an essential business has tightened with premises such as ski centres, large retail showrooms and cosmetic clinics required to closePeople should not travel outside their own local authority area for anything other than ""essential"" reasonsIt is illegal to travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK unless the journey is essential  Level three (very high) rules Pubs and restaurants can open until 18:00, but alcohol can't be servedLeisure and entertainment venues must closeNon-essential travel in or out of the area is not allowedIndoor gym use is restricted to individuals Hairdressers and barbers can open Levels two, one and zero None of these levels currently apply to any area in Scotland. Read Scotland's official guidance. A six-week lockdown began on Boxing Day - which is now legally enforceable, meaning police can order people to return home. The new rules include: Closure of all non-essential shops, including garden centres and homeware storesNo click-and-collect services, apart from supermarketsClosure of hair and beauty salonsHospitality businesses open only for takeaway and deliveryLeisure and entertainment venues must closeOff-licences must close by 20:00Weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals limited to 25 people - wedding receptions not allowed Churches can open for communal service (this is under review) Elite sport allowed behind closed doors  Read Northern Ireland's official guidance. Wales is in a national lockdown at alert level four.

Coronavirus: Do people have to shield and what are the rules?," During the first lockdown, certain people were advised to take extra steps - or shield - to avoid contracting Covid-19, because they were considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment.  As many parts of the UK face more restrictions due to rising cases of coronavirus across the country, what are the recommendations? It's not the same as during the first lockdown, when the advice was to stay at home at all times, but clinically extremely vulnerable people are being advised to take extra precautions. Infection levels in the community reduced over the summer, meaning the risk of exposure became significantly less than in the spring. This allowed some restrictions, including shielding, to be relaxed. But rates of new Covid cases have been rising again in the UK.  The new government guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or attend a medical appointment.   The advice says try to keep all contact with others to a minimum and avoid busy areas. If you go out, maintain strict social distancing, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face. You should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within your household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. What are the symptoms of coronavirus?What are the rules around self-isolation? The only people able to visit you at home are those in your support bubble - such as a relative or other person who helps with your care needs. You can go out and exercise with the people you live with or someone in your bubble.  The advice says you should not leave the house to work. If you cannot work from home, you may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. People on the shielding list are strong advised against visiting any shops, including pharmacies.  If you already have a priority delivery slot with a supermarket, that will continue - you do not need to do anything further. If you cannot access food or medicines, your local council can offer support.  An NHS Volunteer Responders service can help with collecting prescriptions and groceries.  Shielding was never compulsory and it is still your choice to decide what you are comfortable about doing. Everyone in England is expected to follow the lockdown rules. If possible, take things at your own pace and talk through any worries you have.  People who are shielding in Scotland and Wales have been told not to go into work under new lockdown advice. Unlike the lockdown in March 2020, no restrictions will be put on outdoor exercise. In Northern Ireland, medically-vulnerable and older people are advised to be particularly careful in following the recommendations on limiting contacts. People in high risk categories, who include:  Solid organ transplant recipientsSome people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapyPeople on immunosuppression drugsWomen who are pregnant and have heart diseasePeople with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPDSome people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency Adults with Down's syndromeAdults on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease The list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing. Guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says that most youngsters with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and kidney disease do not need to continue to shield and could be removed from the shielding list held by the NHS. About 90,000 people shielding are under 18. Children will only be removed from the shielding list by their GP or specialist doctor after discussions with the child and their family. If you have been told that your child no longer needs to shield, they can go to school, college or nursery.  Children who live with someone who is clinically vulnerable, but aren't themselves, should go to school.

Coronavirus: What it does to the body,"  The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19. For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.  So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated? This is when the virus is establishing itself. Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them. The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face. It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.  At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.  The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average. This is all most people will experience.  Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.  Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed. The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines. These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever. The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.  Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus. These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.   This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus. However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19. This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too. EASY STEPS: How to keep safeA SIMPLE GUIDE:  What are the symptoms?WHO'S AT RISK: Are women and children less affected?CONTAINMENT: What it means to self-isolateMAPS AND CHARTS: Visual guide to the outbreakVIDEO: The 20-second hand wash If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.  Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.  ""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London. Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.  If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs. This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.  Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.  This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China. It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill. By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.  The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.  It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive.  It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines. ""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said. And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.  Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in. But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.  Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts. The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.  The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital. He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating. He died 11 days after he was admitted. The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed. Follow James on Twitter.",BBC News - Health,"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 01:02:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51214864
Support bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours?," Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households.  The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is a group of people with whom you have close physical contact.  Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't start another with a different household. If you decide to change your bubble, you should treat your previous bubble as a separate household for 10 days before forming a new one.  People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household.  The second household can be of any size and can include ""at risk"" people who may be shielding. Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. The government expanded the eligibility of support bubbles in England on 2 December to help families with very young children or people with continuous care needs. This means households can form a support bubble with another household, if at least one of them has:  a child under 1 (regardless of how many other adults are in the household)a child under 5 with a disability that requires continuous care (regardless of how many other adults are in the household)a single adult carer (living with any additional adults in the household that have a disability and need continuous care) As well as the support bubble rules, the government in England also has a set of rules that apply to families with children under 14 (as well as to vulnerable adults).  They can form a childcare bubble with one other household to provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households. Childcare can be provided in either or both of the two homes.  During lockdown, registered childcare and childcare bubbles can continue. Two single people each living alone can bubbleSomeone in a houseshare could bubble - but their housemates wouldn't be allowed to form their own bubbles with other people Full government guidelines for England are here. In Wales, during lockdown, you must not visit other households, or meet other people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble.  Support bubbles can be formed by: households where one adult lives alonehouseholds where one adult lives with any number of children under 18, orhouseholds where more than one adult lives, but one adult has caring responsibilities for all of the other adults in the home People in the same bubble can stay in each other's homes overnight. And they can meet up in groups in some other outdoor places. If you were part of a temporary extended household during the firebreak period, or were in one before that, you can make a new bubble, instead. However, once you have agreed and joined that new extended household, neither household can leave to form a new one. Under the five tier system in Scotland, people who live on their own or only with children under 18 can form an extended household with people from one other household. People in extended households are counted as one household, and so can continue to meet and socialise with each other despite general restrictions on households mixing, and can stay overnight in each other's homes.  Couples who do not live together can also form an extended household, which can include any children they each live with.  A household must not form an extended household with more than one other. However, one of them can end the arrangement at any time, and - as long as they wait at least 14 days - then form a new extended household with someone else.  If any member of an extended household develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Two households of any size can form a support bubble.  The members can spend time indoors and stay overnight with each other.  Under the latest restrictions, these bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people, including children, at any one time.  Read more from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Before the latest lockdown, schools across the UK have been using year group and/or class bubbles to support social distancing and reduce close contact between pupils as much as possible.  Maintaining distinct groups which do not mix makes it quicker and easier when a positive case occurs to identify those who may need to self-isolate and minimise their number.

How to get a Covid test," Liverpool is the first English city to have regular coronavirus testing for all residents, whether they have symptoms or not, as part of a pilot. Testing is considered a key way to control the epidemic, but government's system has experienced setbacks.  Testing people and then tracing the contacts of those infected is vital to stop the disease from spreading.  You should seek a test if you show one of these three key symptoms:  a fevera new continuous cougha loss of smell or taste The idea of testing is to find people with the virus and keep them isolated to avoid it being spread through the wider community. Until you can get a test it's important you and your household self-isolate. What are coronavirus symptoms?Remember the R number? Why is it so important? Go online, or call 119, before going to a drive-through or walk-through testing site - or a mobile testing unitOrder a home testing kit in the first four days of having symptoms Government apologises over Covid tests shortage The testing system experienced plenty of well-publicised problems early on, with people struggling to book.  There were also multiple cases where some people could only book tests many miles from their homes. But the system is running much better now and coping with demand. Roughly 300,000 tests a day on average were processed in the week to 1 November. The government says capacity is more than 500,000, although that number of tests has never actually been carried out in a day.   It has pledged to bring in mass coronavirus testing by the end of the year, even among people with no symptoms. The prime minister has spoken of his desire for 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early 2021, but experts have expressed doubt that this is possible. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the two new testing mega labs - which open in early 2021 - will add 600,000 tests to the UK's daily capacity. The first kind tests to see if you are currently infected. In most cases a nose and throat swab is taken and then sent to be processed at a lab.  There are also rapid turnaround versions of these tests which are mostly available in hospitals. One of the types available uses a technology similar to that of the slower lab tests, but scaled down so it can be processed using a portable machine.  Another, so-called ""lateral flow"" tests - which are being used in the Liverpool pilot - involve a handheld kit that gives a result a bit like a pregnancy test.  Because these miss out the step of amplifying the virus's genetic information, they are less sensitive and will therefore will miss more cases of the virus - especially in people with relatively mild infections.  These lateral flow kits are extremely valuable in areas without big labs, which currently have very little access to any testing at all. But up until recently they haven't been seen as a key part of the UK's testing strategy.  Tests on saliva are also being trialled. The second kind of test involves blood samples and looks for antibodies which indicate past, rather than current, infection.  At the moment, these are mainly being used by scientists to estimate what percentage of the population has had Covid, rather than to diagnose individuals. Private tests can be obtained from clinics and health centres, with some offering a result within three days. Prices vary but are often around Â£100-Â£200 for a swab test - which shows if you are currently infected - and Â£50-Â£100 for an antibody test, which can indicate a past infection. However antibody tests do not work for everyone - and even some people who have had coronavirus do not have antibodies. Tests must have a ''CE mark'' to show they meet all legal criteria. If you test positive, the test supplier must let your local health authority know so it can trace outbreaks. With the most common type of diagnostic test, scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative - wrongly telling someone they are not infected.  This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, there were problems in the lab, or because of the stage of infection the patient was at when tested. Each country records testing slightly differently, so like-for-like comparisons won't be 100% accurate.  However, analysis from Our World In Data, a research team  at the University of Oxford, suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries.  For example, on 1 November, the UK carried out 417 tests per 100,000 people. This compares favourably to similar European countries: in France the number was 433 per 100,000 while in Germany it was 232 and in Spain 247 per 100,000 people.  This just tells us the raw numbers, though, and not how many tests were being carried out in proportion to the size of a country's outbreak, or how well the tests were targeted.

Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings?," People around the UK must now wear face coverings in many public places. The supermarket Morrisons has said it will bar customers who refuse to wear one, unless they are medically exempt. But what protection do they offer, and what sort of coverings can be worn? Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking.  They should mainly be worn to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself.  When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission.  They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms, or are yet to develop them. There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing. Face coverings are now compulsory across the UK when: Travelling on public transportIn shops, supermarkets and shopping centresNot seated at a table to eat or drink in hospitality venues (when open according to the tier system and outside of lockdown) People can be refused travel for not following the rules or fined as a last resort. In England, the police can issue a Â£200 fine to someone breaking the face covering rules. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. In England and Scotland, face coverings are also compulsory in a number of indoor spaces, including:  Banks, building societies and post officesPlaces of worshipMuseums, galleries and entertainment venuesLibraries and public reading rooms Scotland also requires face coverings to be worn in indoor spaces, such as staff canteens and corridors in workplaces. It no longer requires couples to wear them when exchanging marriage vows. In Wales, face coverings must be worn in all indoor public places by customers and staff.  In Northern Ireland, they must be worn in ""any other indoor place where goods or services are available to buy or rent"". Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include: Children (under 11 in England or Wales, under 13 in Northern Ireland, under five in Scotland)Those unable to put on or wear a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or disabilityPeople for whom wearing or removing a face covering will cause severe distressAnyone assisting someone who relies on lip reading to communicate You can remove your mask if: You need to eat, drink, or take medicationA police officer or other official asks you to, or for shop staff to verify your ageYou are entering a shop to avoid harm, if you do not have a mask on you Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation. The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in schools and colleges because of the controls already in place. However, each nation is adopting different rules: In England, secondary schools will have the ''discretion'' to require face coverings in communal areas, where social distancing is not possibleThe Scottish government says all secondary school pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas, and senior pupils (years S4-S6) and their teachers must wear them in classIn addition, all staff in Scottish schools must wear masks where social distancing is not possibleIn Wales, face coverings are recommended in high schools when social distancing is ""unlikely to be maintained"", but are not compulsoryIn Northern Ireland, face coverings must be worn in the corridors of post-primary schools However, they will be mandatory for schools in parts of England that are under local restrictions, but not in classrooms.   The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.  The government has issued its own advice too. Face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection as the masks that healthcare workers wear.  World Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. They help us protect each other and reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms, or are yet to develop symptoms.

Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?," Most people with coronavirus will recover within about a week of getting symptoms and will not need medical care. But some people will need to be treated in hospital - as the prime minister was.  Boris Johnson, who is 55, has been discharged from St Thomas' hospital in London after being in intensive care. He was given oxygen, but didn't need a ventilator machine to help his breathing.  Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said male sex is ""a very clear risk factor"". But why? Some people are at higher risk of complications.  This includes people over the age of 70, regardless of whether they have a medical condition or not, and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as heart disease.  There are more than 1.5 million people in the UK who are at the greatest risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus.  This includes people with cancer who have been receiving chemotherapy, and they are being asked to stay at home all of the time to shield themselves from the virus. Coronavirus also appears to disproportionately affect men in their 50s and 60s to a certain degree, although they are not singled out as a high risk group. But it's not that clear-cut. Correlation isn't necessarily cause. Scientists are unsure.  UK data from intensive care hospital wards shows the average patient who is critically ill is aged 60. Most are men and many have other health conditions that could put them at increased risk, such as heart problems and obesity. Of the 647 coronavirus-related deaths registered by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales up to the week ending 27th March, 44 were aged 45-65 - around 7% of the total. Death rates go up with age in both men and women, but men tend to outstrip women across the ages. Data from China, where the pandemic began, also suggests men are at greater risk than women, although experts caution there could be factors other than gender, such as smoking habits, that could explain the link.  Prof Ian Hall, Professor of Molecular Medicine, University of Nottingham, said: ""I am not convinced this completely explains the increased risk of severe disease in men, so it seems possible there may be some other as yet unidentified factor playing a role."" Men are more likely than women to have heart disease, diabetes and chronic lung disease. Some have suggested genes and sex hormones might be involved too. Prof Philip Goulder, an expert in immunology at University of Oxford, said: ""It is becoming increasingly recognised that there are substantial differences in the immune system between males and females and that these have significant impact on outcome from a wide range of infectious diseases. ""The immune response throughout life to vaccines and infections is typically more aggressive and more effective in females compared to males."" This could be down to women carrying two copies of the X chromosome, compared to the single X and a Y that men have.  A number of critical immune genes are located on the X chromosome, he says. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. People with underlying health conditions and the elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. The Office for National Statistics has been assessing how many of the deaths linked to coronavirus might be as a direct result of the virus.  This analysis suggests that most (86% or 3,372) of the 4,000 deaths linked to coronavirus in March were likely caused by the virus, although around nine in every ten of those who died had a pre-existing health condition. The coronavirus death rate was twice as high for men compared to women - 97.5 deaths per 100,000 population versus 46.5 deaths per 100,000. Stay as fit and healthy as you can by exercising and eating a balanced diet.  If you smoke, now is a good time to quit.  Men are more likely than women to: smoke and smoke more cigarettes per day and smoke hand-rolled tobaccoeat too much salteat too much red and processed meateat too little fruit and too few vegetablesdrink alcohol and drink at hazardous levels Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.

Covid-19: Early years staff 'should have vaccine priority'," Staff working in nurseries and pre-school settings should be given priority for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, say early years groups. While schools across England closed their doors to most pupils last week, early years settings are still open. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the decision to keep nurseries open ""needs to be looked at"". But England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said settings were open to support working families. The Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (Pacey), Early Years Alliance (EYA) and National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) want vaccine priority for staff, and also mass testing in early years settings. They are also urging the government to reinstate early entitlement funding support for settings which have had to close, or have seen a fall in the demand for funded places. The organisations also want targeted funding for providers, like childminders, who have suffered from falls in parental demand.  Neil Leitch, chief executive of the EYA, said: ""It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so.  ""We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk.""  Pacey chief executive Liz Bayram said: ""We need better financial support, not just for settings that have to close, but for the many who decide to continue to provide services despite the risks and the significantly reduced numbers of children in attendance.  ""Many Pacey members, most of whom are self-employed and on low incomes, cannot afford to temporarily close their business regardless of risk, and have no choice but to carry on."" Chief executive of NDNA, Purnima Tanuku, said the government was asking early years providers ""to go above and beyond"" in this lockdown and ""cannot be an afterthought for ministers"". ""Now, they are the only part of the education sector fully open to all children and must be given priority,"" she said. 'Show us it's safe' to be open, say nursery staffNursery staff 'torn between duty and fear'Very little' virus risk at nurseries, says vaccine minister One BBC website reader, Jeanette, contacted us to voice her concern about a relative working in the early years sector. She said it was impossible for staff to maintain social distancing from each other when working with young children. ""It is not the children who are the risk at nurseries - it is the co-workers who are very often working in settings which are fairly small rooms, with four adults working closely with the children,"" she told the BBC. ""It's the transmission between adults that I'm worried about. It is impossible for them to maintain social distancing when working with the children. ""The staff are not allowed to wear PPE of any sort, including clear facial visors, for apparent fear of upsetting the children whose parents obviously wear facial coverings."" Jeanette said it would be ""wonderful"" if staff could get the vaccine, but said that with early years staff being generally quite young, she thought this was unlikely at the moment. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty told the BBC that nurseries were open ""to allow people who need to go to work or need to do particular activities to do so"". He added: ""We all do know that children are at very, very low risk of this virus relative to other ages. The fact that nurseries are open, it's not a risk to the children."" The Department for Education said all essential workers, including all education and childcare workers, had access to priority testing via the online booking portal.   The department said that under the priority groups for the first phase of vaccine rollout, those over 50 and those in a risk group, would be eligible for vaccination within the first phase of the programme.  ""The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has asked the Department of Health and Social Care to consider occupational vaccination in the next phase of vaccine rollout,"" said a spokeswoman.

BBC Bitesize to be free for BT and EE customers," Customers using BT Mobile, EE, and Plusnet Mobile can use BBC Bitesize content from the end of January without eating into their data allowance. Bitesize provides structured lessons in maths and English for all year groups, as well as offering other curriculum material. Content from other providers is likely to be made free in the coming days. More mobile companies are expected to follow suit in making such content free to use. The current UK lockdowns mean most children are now learning from home. In England, primary and secondary schools have moved to remote learning for most pupilsIn Scotland, schools will remain closed to the majority of pupils until at least 1 FebruaryIn Wales, all schools and colleges will move to online learning until at least the end of  JanuaryIn Northern Ireland, many pupils will not return to school until after the half-term break in mid-February Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has mandated that schools must provide between three and five hours of online content per day. This has led to concerns that children in families without access to broadband could fall behind. Schools remain open for children classed as vulnerable and those whose parents are key workers. Lockdown learning: BBC puts school materials on TV, iPlayer and onlineCovid 19: The challenges of home-schoolingHow to be the school of mum and dad (again) All contract and pay-as-you-go customers of BT Mobile, EE and Plusnet Mobile will be eligible and the free package will continue while schools remain closed. No registration is required - the free access will happen automatically. BT has also asked the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to each suggest one online resource for schoolchildren in its regions, which it will also zero-rate, as the curriculums differ from English schools. According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, some 880,000 families are reliant solely on mobile connections, and many of those will have data limitations. BBC director general Tim Davie said: ""With the pandemic forcing schools to close again, we should not allow a lack of digital access to further impact children's education. ""The BBC will continue to do all we can to ensure every child, whatever their circumstances, can continue to access vital educational materials during this time."" The corporation is also running three hours of curriculum-based TV programmes alongside the BBC Bitesize collection of educational resources. Primary school programming will be on CBBC, with two hours for secondary pupils on BBC Two.  During the first lockdown, content was available on iPlayer, Red Button services and online, but not on regular TV channels, although viewers in Scotland did have some programming. BT said the move was part of its wider Lockdown Learning programme.

The two head teachers' unions, NAHT and ASCL, say the high numbers attending could hamper the fight against the virus. The Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils who can attend. It is insisting that schools ensure all children who qualify can attend. The widened categories not only include vulnerable pupils and children of workers in critical occupations but also those who cannot access remote learning either because they do not have devices or space to study.  Children of parents working on the Brexit arrangements are also included. Teachers have described streets around schools being packed with parents dropping off their children and almost all staff having to come in and work despite the lockdown. Heads say they fear schools could be overwhelmed by children who do not have access to lap tops to learn remotely. Jessica Jane, a learning assistant at a school in Hampshire, told the BBC: ""I work in a primary school where we are having to bring in every single member of staff as the list of key-workers is vast in our area and over 50% of our children are attending. ""Our community school is not closed and streets are packed with parents morning and afternoon collecting their children from open schools."" She added: ""My colleagues and I are still being put at risk every single day as are our families."" A teacher from the Midlands who did not wish to be named said the number had risen from 10 pupils a day in the first lockdown to about 90 a day this week.  ""We're talking just under to just over a third of the usual amount of pupils for our school here.   ""The vast majority are key worker children, not vulnerable.  ""I also know that other primary schools in our area have similar amounts of children in school - one neighbouring school in particular, which is only slightly larger than us, is estimating/averaging 100 to 160 children in school every day."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called the lack of limits ""bizarre... in a week when the prime minister has told the nation that it is necessary to move schools to remote education in order to suppress coronavirus transmission"". ""We are hearing reports that attendance in some primary schools is in excess of 50% because of demand from critical workers and families with children classed as vulnerable under criteria which has been significantly widened,"" he said. ""We are urgently seeking clarification about the maximum number who should be in school while protecting public health. ""This seems completely illogical given the fact that the government has taken the drastic action of a full national lockdown precisely in order to limit contacts."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said schools could not ""meet the demand created by government and reduce social mixing in the way the prime minister announced"". ""The government acknowledges that schools do play a role in the transmission of the virus. Therefore, there comes a point when occupancy levels might be so high that they work against the efforts to bring down infection rates in communities, as is the national aim.  ""This could result in prolonging the amount of time pupils are away from the classroom, which we are all anxious to avoid."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.  ""If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services. ""The protective measures that schools have been following throughout the autumn term remain in place to help protect staff and students, while the national lockdown helps reduce transmission in the wider community."" But Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association, reflected head teachers' concerns, saying between 40 and 60% of pupils were attending schools across England. ""The real problem is we have got two different national narratives going on,"" she said - with the prime minister saying ""stay at home"" but the DfE telling schools to take all eligible children who turn up. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government seemed unable to decide whether schools were safe or unsafe. Commenting on the latest Coronavirus Infection Survey from the Office for National Statistics, Dr Bousted, said: ""Let this data end their confusion. Schools are clearly driving infection amongst children, and then onto the wider community.  ""This peaked on Christmas Day with one in every 27 secondary-age children and one in 40 primary-age children infected.  ""In London this rises to one in 18 secondary pupils and one in 23 primary pupils. These figures are truly shocking and entirely the result of government negligence.""",BBC News - Family & Education,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 14:57:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-55579711
Covid-19: The challenges of home-schooling," A mother wakes at dawn to copy out worksheets for her children on to pieces of paper. Secondary school pupils attempt to write essays on their mobile phones, while younger children queue to wait their turn on the one computer in the house. That, according to the Child Poverty Action Group, was the reality of remote learning in some homes in the first UK lockdown in March 2020. ""We spoke to thousands of parents, carers and children and the thing we heard was that up to  40% of them did not only not have access to a laptop or the internet, but also to other things like printers, even stationery and craft materials,"" said Kate Anstey, a project lead at the charity. Now, as we enter another lockdown that could last until the February half-term or beyond, the government wants even more online learning - with schools mandated to provide at least three hours per day and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson calling on parents to report schools who are not providing enough resources. How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Lockdown Learning: What's the BBC doing to help children?How parents plan to tackle home-schooling It is estimated that 2.6 million schoolchildren live below the poverty line in England alone, and Ofcom estimates that about 9% of children in the UK - between 1.1 million and 1.8 million - do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home. More than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection. Businesses and charities are helping out. The London Grid for Learning (LGfL) has a scheme called Bridge the Divide, which is leading a nationwide procurement scheme for two million cheap Chromebooks and WinBooks. And to help those without devices, the government has sent out more than half a million laptops to the schools in most need.  But the government help ""isn't going far enough,"" thinks Ms Anstey, and even when laptops are arriving, the problems aren't over.  ""We have heard from schools that have had laptops, but they have arrived without the right software,"" she said. To help parents struggling to afford data, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone are planning free access to the Oak National Academy online lessons, so that families can continue to learn from home without using any of their mobile data allowance until the end of the academic year. The networks are completing their technical tests over the coming weeks before rolling it out. Do what you can. You don't have to become a teacher. You are a parent and what your child needs most is what parents give best - love and support.  Provide a structure to the day - this does not need to be a strict timetable. And for younger children, keep the afternoons free for more fun activities, craft, cooking, PE. If you can, set up a small workstation for your child. Headphones could help for online lessons. If you have a Playstation or Xbox, but not an extra computer, both Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom can be accessed via the consoles. Talking and reading don't need devices - and both are vital skills. Practise the basics, like multiplication tables, playing with money, or imaginative role-play. Matt Lawson lives in Cumbria and has four children of school age. His broadband and mobile signal is so bad that he has to rely on the schools his children attend sending work by post. For his daughter, studying for GCSEs it is particularly hard. ""She was also involved in a lot of clubs which are carrying on on Zoom so she can't join in. It is ridiculous."" Some schools are ahead of the game because they embraced the digital curriculum before the pandemic. Phil Hedger is chief executive of the LEO Academy Trust, a group of six schools in the London Borough of Sutton. Back in 2018, it decided to provide every child with a Chromebook, and in lockdown has found children have thrived because they were used to the technology. ""What works online is high-quality short bursts of teacher-led learning for 15 or 20 minutes, and then offline activities,"" he said. Not all lessons the school provides are live. Some are pre-recorded and there is a plethora of excellent resources already online from places such as BBC Bitesize for teachers to draw on. One Monday, the BBC is also launching curriculum-based programmes for primary and secondary school children, on terrestrial TV channels CBBC and BBC Two. If teachers do provide live lessons, they stay online afterwards to help children who are struggling.  And children know the etiquette of video conferencing, including how to mute themselves and even setting up their own meetings to support their peers. For children without access to the internet, the school provides dongles for a mobile connection. Jonty Clark is chief executive of the Beckmead Trust, which caters for 400 vulnerable children with complex needs. He took matters into his own hands and secured funding from two charities to supply laptops and dongles to both their own and partner schools at the beginning of the first lockdown. It paid dividends. Some of the older children were ""already involved with the justice system"", he said, and having laptops has kept them off the streets and stopped them offending. And for some children, such as those with autism, working at home on a laptop has seen them ""flourish"" academically. I'm just coming up for air after painstakingly copying 17 circles divided into various fractions on to a piece of paper for my seven-year-old to colour in because yup, my printer has packed up. My children are both in primary school. We have yet to have any ""live"" lessons - instead we get pre-recorded videos, Powerpoint presentations and other materials shared on Google Classroom. They also have to play online maths and spelling games. The boys have separate log-ins and are in different years, so need at least one device each. Because there is still a focus on handwriting, I have to submit photos of their work. This is proving tricky because their Google Classroom log-ins do not enable me to access my own Google drive . So far, I am emailing photos to myself from my phone, putting them on my desktop and then uploading them from there. My nine-year-old declares that he is doing more work in home-school than he did in ""real"" school - although he is delighted with his new-found knowledge that he can look up ""naughty words"" in the dictionary. It feels like half-term is a long way away. ""The last few days have been some of the most stressful of my life,"" one parent, who didn't want to be named, told the BBC. Both he and his wife work full-time, but now have to fit in live spelling lessons, Powerpoint presentations and spreadsheets. In desperation at the sheer workload, he has had to turn to his 60-year-old mother for help. She has previously had health issues, so the solution is not without risk. Parenting expert Harriet Shearsmith thinks families should take the resources from schools but adapt them to their own routine and the needs of their child. With a five-year-old, an eight-year-old and a nine-year-old, she summed up the frustration of many. ""Today I spent 90 minutes on a maths sheet looking at a long multiplication which I didn't even get myself.

IGCSE exams taken in private schools still going ahead," The IGCSE exams, usually only taken in private schools, are still going ahead this summer - even though GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled. Exam boards that run IGCSEs plan to offer them, while many other exams have been stopped by the pandemic. IGCSE qualifications, alternative exams to GCSEs, are not usually available in state schools. Pupils in England whose A-levels and GCSEs are cancelled will depend on replacement grades from teachers. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's scrapping of exams this summer does not apply to students taking IGCSEs. A Department for Education report in 2019 found 94% of IGCSEs were taken in private schools, accounting for 164,000 exam entries. The decision not to cancel them was welcomed by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), representing some of the most prestigious independent schools. The HMC's general secretary, Simon Hyde, said their schools ""would be the first to cheer if pupils educated by the state had the same opportunity"". Teachers' grades to be used to replace GCSEs and A-levelsCancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say studentsVocational exams to go ahead ""The decision to cancel GCSEs was premature. Exams are the fairest way of assessing what learners know and understand and we would like to see as many pupils as possible take a form of exam in the summer,"" said Dr Hyde. Independent schools often offer a mix of IGCSEs and GCSEs for different subjects, although IGCSEs do not count towards school league tables. The qualifications - International GCSEs - are offered by Cambridge Assessment and Pearson and are taken in other countries as well as the UK. Both boards say they are planning to go ahead with exam papers for UK schools this summer. IGCSEs were not included in the cancellation of exams announced by England's Department for Education and it will be up to individual schools to decide whether to continue with them. Julie McCullloch of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""It creates another inconsistency, but none of this is easy."" She said it created an ""odd situation"" when GCSEs were cancelled but IGCSEs were going ahead, but she recognised that an international qualification could need a common approach across different countries. With the latest lockdown and most pupils studying at home, GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, the exams watchdog Ofqual will launch a consultation next week on a replacement way of deciding grades - but Ofqual does not regulate IGCSEs and they will not be part of the watchdog's proposals.",BBC News - Family & Education,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 12:34:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-55581576
Students pledge rent strike over unused uni rooms," Growing numbers of students in England have pledged to withhold rent on university accommodation they cannot use during the Covid lockdown. Organisers say this is building up to be a major protest, estimating that about 15,000 students at dozens of universities have signed up so far.  They want a rebate on rent when many students are being kept off campus at the start of term. But universities say they only provide 20% of student accommodation.  Universities UK says this means ""many decisions on refunds will be made by private landlords and other providers"". In November, University of Manchester offered a 30% rent rebate for the first half of the academic year, worth about Â£1,000 to each student in halls.  The move followed protests over lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic which saw students tear down temporary fencing in one demonstration. The reduction will be applied to direct debit payments this month, with students who have already paid for the whole year getting a refund. But organiser of the Rent Strike Now campaign, Ben McGowan, said the new lockdown means students are still paying for halls they are unable to return to which has prompted a wave of student anger.  On Twitter, campaigners listed more than 40 universities where they said students were pledging to withhold rent.  ""Most of us are being told not to go back so we're paying for accommodation we can't use and there's been no extra support from universities and government,"" added Saranya Thambiranjah, a first year at Bristol University who also helps run the campaign. ""Rent striking is a great way to make our voices heard and get universities to listen our concerns.""  Students at universities not yet part of this campaign have said they will organise similar challenges on their own campuses, including Coventry and Keele.   At Nottingham Trent University, student campaigner Rebecca Hyde, who is doing a masters in broadcast journalism, said 244 students had so far pledged to withhold rent on university halls since their campaign was launched a few days ago.  She believes universities should do more to help students who are having to pay for rooms they are unable to use through no fault of their own.  She says her course leaders have been brilliant but missing out on using studios and running ""news days"" with her fellow students ""is just so disappointing"".  Nottingham Trent University says it understands student concerns over rents and urged the government ""to show leadership to find a solution that is fair to all students"".  ""At NTU, only a minority of our students are in accommodation operated by or on behalf of the university.  ""We do not want a repeat of the situation in the summer term of 2020 where most of our students were reliant on the goodwill of private accommodation providers who did not always do the right thing,"" said the university in a statement. At King's College London, campaign secretary ""Juno"" likewise reported hundreds of new pledges to withhold rent in the past few days, saying students felt they had been ""lured"" into their accommodation  at the start of the academic year.  A King's spokesperson promised that students would not be charged for accommodation they are unable to use during lockdown.  About a quarter of students are in privately-run purpose built accommodation, and one of the biggest of these providers, Unite Students, is also facing demands.  Liverpool John Moores student Suhail Accad, in Unite accommodation, says his rent strike post on Instagram has gained 3,000 followers and has had 8,000 shares in just a few days.  ""It's expensive to stay here,"" says Suhail.  Unite was unable to comment directly on the threat of rent strikes but maintains that it is doing all it can to help keep students and staff safe ""during this challenging period"". Universities UK said universities were looking at the issue ""actively"" and considering what support they can offer students.  ""Universities recognise the financial pressures the pandemic has placed on students and are providing increased financial and other support as a result. ""With government restrictions reducing the numbers of students returning in person to universities, now is the time for the government to seriously consider the financial implications for students and institutions and what support they will provide.""

Covid-19: Government denies 'snubbing' BT's wi-fi for pupils offer," The government has denied it ""snubbed"" an offer from telecoms giant BT to provide disadvantaged children with internet access for remote learning.  BT said the government had ""struggled to distribute"" the wi-fi vouchers and ""effectively handed them back to us"". However a spokesman for the education department said a pilot of the scheme had not provided ""reliable and consistent"" internet connection. UK schools are closed to most pupils as part of coronavirus lockdown measures.  Teachers have had to revert to online learning, as was the case during the first lockdown in the Spring. However concerns has been raised over how this is impacting disadvantaged families who don't have internet access.  How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data feesBBC to put lessons on TV during lockdown In a letter to BT, Labour MP Sarah Owen urged the company to provide school children ""who cannot afford it with internet access so that they can learn, achieve and stay connected"". In response Marc Allera, head of BT's consumer brands division, said: ""BT was the first telecoms operator to have an offer for vulnerable families"", adding that it had offered BT wi-fi vouchers from June 2020. ""Unfortunately the Department of Education struggled to distribute these vouchers effectively and handed them back to us,"" he wrote. The pressure is on both the government and telecoms companies to do more to close the digital divide. It was while defending its own approach to a Labour MP that BT revealed the free broadband offer it had made to the education secretary. BT Basic is, as the name implies, a pretty basic service offering a phone line and a 10Mbps broadband service to anyone on Universal Credit or other benefits for Â£10 a month. It seems that Gavin Williamson did not find an invitation to subsidise a slow service which would still leave a family struggling to video stream lessons very attractive.  There would also have been competition issues in the use of public money to back a dominant player in the fiercely competitive broadband market. Nevertheless, having failed to come up with convincing answers to closing the digital divide during last Spring's lockdown, both the government and the telecoms giant are now scrambling to show they can do better this time around. BT also said it offered to prioritise putting vulnerable families on an ""affordable broadband tariff"". ""The department declined this route, wanting something faster,"" he added: ""We regret this decision as had the Department for Education taken this approach then many of these families would have affordable and unlimited broadband by now."" BT has said it is now offering ""free unlimited"" mobile data for families without internet access and that, by the end of the month, it aims to implement zero-rating of popular education websites, meaning children won't lose data when on these sites. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said it was ""shocking and utterly disgraceful"" that education secretary Gavin Williamson had ""snubbed an offer of cheap broadband for kids"". However, the government said her claims were ""completely wrong"".  ""The department did pilot the BT WiFi Hotspot scheme, but it did not suitably meet children and young people's needs for a reliable and consistent internet connection to access remote education,"" a spokesman said.

"Show us it's safe' to be open, say nursery staff"," Childcare organisations are demanding to see evidence that it is safe for them to remain open while schools and colleges have closed to most pupils. Staff have close contact with children and babies daily, when they change nappies and receive them by the hand from parents, for example. Ministers have insisted early years settings are safe as young children have very low rates of the virus.  Nurseries argue the evidence cited is based on data about old variant Covid. 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - ministerWhy are nurseries still open this time around?'It is more important my daughter goes to nursery' England's three main nursery organisations, the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association and childminders' group, Pacey, have joined together to mount a #ProtectEarlyYears campaign.  They want the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early years staff of staying open, particularly in light of the increased transmissibility of the new variant of Covid-19. Sue Cardy, owner and manager of Ready Teddy Go Pre School, in Shoeburyness, Essex said: ""There isn't anyone who has asked: 'Is it 100% safe for us to remain fully open? No one can see the virus and staff may be asymptomatic, and so we all run an element of risk of catching or spreading it."" She added: ""Staff have families and are not all young... 50% of my staff are over 50 and some have underlying medical conditions."" Vicky, the manager of a church pre-school in Cheshire West and Chester said she could potentially have 30 children plus 10 staff in a church hall, with no PPE recommended, and limited social distancing. ""As an early years provider, I am increasingly worried about the safety of both staff and children, yet if we chose to partially close, we could be financially penalised."" And Georgie Morrell from Brighton and Hove said: ""Since re-opening, I have had four households tell me. they are Covid positive.  ""This is clearly very close to home and yet we have been given no choice or support but to remain open and carry on."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so.  ""We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk. That is why it is vital that the government takes the urgent steps needed to safeguard those working in the sector, particularly mass testing and priority access to vaccinations.

Fears schools will be overwhelmed by laptopless pupils," There are concerns some schools in lockdown could be inundated with pupils without laptops after a change to the vulnerable pupil list. Pupils are learning remotely in England after schools were closed on Tuesday to all but children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable.  But those without laptops or space to study are now eligible to attend school, under government guidance. Heads' union, NAHT, said the move could reduce the effect of the shutdown. Schools were ordered to close to most pupils as a way of limiting the spread of the virus. National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said demand for key worker and vulnerable places in schools had risen substantially since the last school shutdown. Nearly a third of the 2,000 head teachers who joined an online union meeting on Wednesday afternoon reported having between 20 and 30% of pupils in school, the NAHT said. Mr Whiteman said: ""It is critical that key worker child school places are only used when absolutely necessary to truly reduce numbers and spread of the virus. ""We have concern that the government has not supplied enough laptops for all the children without them and so has made lack of internet access a vulnerable criteria - only adding to numbers still in school.  What's happening with schools across the country?Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says GoveWe've all seen this coming, say angry headsHow to be the school of Mum and Dad (again) ""It is important that all vulnerable pupils have access to a school place, but the government must provide laptops and internet access for every pupil that needs one, so that they can access home learning to take some of the strain off the demand for school places. ""Nearly half of head teachers who we polled during a webcast on Wednesday evening said that had received fewer than 10% of the laptops they'd requested.  ""It is essential that this is rectified immediately, so that we can keep school attendance figures at a level which will have the desired impact on getting transmission rates under control."" Jane Girt, head teacher of Carlton Bolling College in Bradford, said the rule change could leave her having to accommodate an extra 200 pupils on top of those already on the key worker and vulnerable children list. She told BBC News that having so many pupils in school would ""defeat the object"" of closing amid the England-wide lockdown. Mrs Girt said her secondary, which has more than 1,500 students, had received 261 laptops from the government since March but about 50% of pupils were sharing a device with another family member. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that 560,000 devices had been given out to schools in 2020 and a further 50,000 so far this week. And Gavin Williamson reiterated that those without access to remote learning via digital devices could attend school. He said: ""Schools are much better prepared to deliver online learning, with the delivery of hundreds of thousands of devices at breakneck speed, data support and high quality video lessons."" But Ofcom estimates there are up to 1.5m pupils without digital devices in their homes, on which they can learn. Amanda Bailey, director of the child poverty commission in north-east England, said pupils without internet access tended to be concentrated in disadvantaged areas and this meant some schools would be ""largely fully open"", she said. ""And we know that the most deprived communities are the ones most vulnerable to the health impact of the pandemic,"" she added. ""Our main concerns are that we're now nine months into this situation and we're still talking about families not having sufficient access to digital devices or data or the internet.""

Teachers' grades to replace A-levels and GCSEs in England," Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"".  She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools  Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say studentsNorthern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levelsExams cancelled in England's latest lockdownVocational exams allowed to go aheadThe big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.",BBC News - Family & Education,"Wed, 06 Jan 2021 17:03:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-55561838
Covid-19: SEND families' struggles amplified in lockdown," Parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) say they feel ""abandoned and let down"" over lockdown provision. Some are waiting to see if their child can still attend school, while others have been ""point blank refused"". The SEND Action group said: ""As in the last lockdown many are being turned away because they are not regarded as vulnerable enough."" The government said it was prioritising children with special needs. It announced a third lockdown on Monday, with schools being closed except for children deemed ""vulnerable"". This term does not only mean children in care but also those with special educational needs and who have an EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan). Mother of two Jen Smith, from Bristol, spent two years in a legal battle to get an EHCP in place, as well as an education provision at a specialist school in South Gloucestershire. ""It's a worrying time,"" she said. ""I have a child with an EHCP who already missed most of year seven and eight and it's taking the first term of year nine to get him settled into a new school that could meet his needs.  ""Now that we've just gone into lockdown there's no guarantee that he'll get a place."" She said she was waiting to hear back from her son's school and things were ""up in the air"". ""We live in an overcrowded flat and we don't have the space to really properly do home learning."" She also felt that nationally, the system for SEND was ""a mess"". ""We have head teachers who are pitted against the government and then parents pitted against the schools and head teachers.  ""It feels like a constant ongoing fight."" For other parents, lockdown has meant more struggles alongside a long-running ""battle"" to secure an EHCP. Those parents have a My Support Plan in place for their child, which is a level below the EHCP.  It means the school recognises the child has additional needs but unlike the EHCP, there is no ring-fenced funding in place. 'Has all my work gone down the drain?''Scared' nursery staff turn up for work'How do I teach eight children with one laptop?' Special needs teacher Jennifer Holt, from Huddersfield, says her 10-year-old son is waiting to get a EHCP and is awaiting an autism diagnosis by independent specialists. He has been already diagnosed with severe dyslexia and dyspraxia. She said: ""Not being able to attend for another, probably minimum two months, it's going to make him step back.  ""He is so difficult to get engaged in any formal learning, which the school know about.  ""He won't get any formal education at all, he won't engage any written work at home, he won't contribute to any Zoom meetings. He shuts down."" She said his school class size was small so social distancing measures were achievable. ""It's so soul-destroying how much you have to fight for this brilliant little person that you've got, that you know how brilliant they are and other people fail to, or don't want to recognise or support them.  ""The feeling of rejection I had was heartbreaking."" A spokesman for Kirklees Council said: ""Like all local authorities, we are supporting schools to continue to provide the best possible standards of safety, care and education at an incredibly difficult time for schools and families. ""If this particular family would like to contact us, we would be keen to discuss their circumstances."" While some parents remain in limbo, for others the decision to remain at home has been based on medical grounds. Rumya Kumar, from Swindon, has decided to keep her 13-year old son, who has autism, at home as she has lupus. She kept him home during the national lockdown last March, but his condition deteriorated as a result. ""He is quite happy not to go out, to stay at home with no school.  ""But the problem is the more he stays at home, which is his comfort zone, then the harder it gets to send him to school.""  She added that it took him the whole of the winter term to readjust to school. Due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, she said the doctors had to increase his anxiety medication to help him cope. Ms Kumar also hopes to be vaccinated soon so her son can return on a part-time basis.

It had been temporarily pulled but the council has since confirmed transport would be in place for the the twice-daily two-hour round trip. She said she would have been unable to drive him there, as she also had to home-school her son. ""It feels as though the SEND children, the Cinderella siblings with the education system, have just been forgotten about again,"" she said.  ""To be fair, the government hasn't been on top of anything to do with education in this pandemic. ""If we feel that the children generally have been at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the government's concern then SEND children aren't even on the ladder."" She added that SEND children needed to be prioritised. ""All schools, special schools included, have to find a way to make it work for those children who want to be at school... the government and the local authorities need to work together to make sure that that can happen,"" said Ms Marshment. ""We have very little reserve left to get us through.  ""We need this support, it's not an optional extra.""  A SEND action group spokeswoman said: ""In order to close the gap between rhetoric and reality, DfE and the government need to engage with special schools and families of disabled children regarding the particular challenges these schools face and the support required to address them."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We have prioritised vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities throughout the pandemic."" They said they were addressing issues ""urgently"", that ""alternative provision schools remain open"" and that the government would ""publish guidance in due course"".",BBC News - Family & Education,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 06:39:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-55551913
"Lockdown Learning: BBC puts school materials on TV, iPlayer and online"," The BBC is helping school children keep up with their studies amid the latest lockdown to control Covid-19 in the UK.  Primary and secondary schools are closed to most pupils, and from Monday 11 January, lessons and programmes will start to be broadcast on TV - on BBC Two and CBBC - as well as on iPlayer, with additional content online. The curriculum-based TV programmes will run alongside the BBC Bitesize collection of educational resources, which will continue to provide online learning at home for pupils in Years 1 to 9, and those studying for GCSEs and Nationals.   On TV, there will be three hours of primary school programming on CBBC, and two hours for secondary pupils on BBC Two. During the first lockdown last spring, content was available on iPlayer, Red Button services and online, but not on regular television channels. The move to TV comes amid concerns many families are struggling to provide the technology and internet connections for their children to take part in online learning. How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees Tim Davie, BBC director general, says ensuring children across the UK have the opportunity to continue to follow the core parts of the school curriculum has been a key priority for the corporation. ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and I'm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly."" Online - learning resources for children of all ages can be found on the BBC Bitesize website. TV -  programming for primary school pupils will be on CBBC between 09:00 and 12.00 every weekday. Programmes for secondary school pupils will be on BBC Two, between 13:00 and 15:00.  Red Button - the Bitesize Daily lessons will also be shown on the Red Button service on TV.  iPlayer - all episodes will be available on catch-up, on demand on iPlayer. For primary and secondary pupils in Scotland, there will be dedicated programming on BBC Scotland from 10:00, every weekday for about two hours. For children studying in Welsh, there is bilingual support on the BBC Bitesize website, with activities to support home learning. Go to the ""change language"" button and select the Welsh language to access it. Pupils in Northern Ireland can go to the BBC Northern Ireland website to find more information to help their studies. There will be both lessons and educational programmes. For primary school pupils, CBBC will show BBC Bitesize Daily as well as popular shows such as Our School, Celebrity Supply Teacher, Horrible Histories, Art Ninja and Operation Ouch. The Bitesize Daily lessons on TV will feature a different subject each day, with the programming kicking off on Monday at 09:00 with maths - 20-minutes of teaching for five-to-seven year-olds, and then tuition for seven-to-nine year-olds and those aged nine-to-11. Lessons in English, science and French will follow over the next few days. The Celebrity Supply Teacher programme at 10:05 will feature the likes of footballer Marcus Rashford on PE and singer Geri Horner's English tips. BBC Two will cater for secondary students, with new content to support the curriculum, including drama adaptations, and science, history and factual titles. Science for 11-14 year-olds is the focus in the first week's Bitesize Daily lesson programme at 13:00, and this will be followed by a screening of The Planets presented by Prof Brian Cox. The BBC Bitesize social media channels will be there to help - with Facebook and Twitter accounts focusing on parents and teachers, including articles on supporting children's learning from home.

Cancelled exams are a 'big disappointment'," ""It's a big disappointment,"" says 17-year-old Jake from Buckinghamshire, following the news that this summer's A-levels have been cancelled. ""The first thing I thought was, 'What am I going to do?' ""I was calling my friends - everyone was just as shocked as I was, knowing that this is a big change that could affect our futures."" Jake has been studying for A-levels in physics, maths and chemistry and plans to do a year's internship with the Army before going on to do a physics degree. He feels that he, and many others, will now not be able to reach their full potential, particularly if their predicted grades are not what they had hoped for. ""I have been working a lot harder and I feel I can do better in my exams, but I feel like I'm not going to get that chance now.   ""And because we're going to be spending less time in school, I know over a zoom lesson it's going to be a lot harder for me to show teachers that I can do a lot better.""  'Why haven't our BTec exams been cancelled too?'Schools closed 'with heaviest of hearts' says GoveSchools to close and exams facing axe in England Jake says politicians have let young people down. ""I remember watching [Education Secretary] Gavin Williamson in Parliament a month ago say 'We're not going to let Covid damage the life chances of students by cancelling exams'.  ""I believed what he said and I thought that here was someone looking out for me, but now the complete opposite has happened."" He added: ""There is a sense of anger, a sense of being let down. I feel like the government isn't looking out for me."" But not all exams have been cancelled - BTec qualifications are still going ahead at this stage. Eighteen-year-old BTec student Joe, from Beaconsfield, is annoyed that his exams have not been cancelled and says it is not right that A-level students are likely to be get predicted grades, while BTec students will not. ""It's definitely unfair,"" says Joe.  ""Exams versus predicted grades will put me at a disadvantage when competing for university places -  if I had predicted grades it would probably be of benefit to me."" His mother, Sharon, adds: ""They will be competing for the same university places but will have completely different methods of examination."" The news of further disruption to education due to school closures has impacted families too. Mother-of-two Victoria Slatter told the BBC she was ""gutted and heart-broken"" that children were facing ""yet more disruption"" to their education. ""It's not just the educational side of school, it's the social interaction, it's seeing their friends, it's the routine and the structure of being in the school environment that they miss. ""My two children really struggled during the first lockdown with that element."" Commenting on the BBC's Education and Family Facebook pages, many parents said they were processing Monday night's announcement that schools will be closed to the majority of pupils. Emma Nice said: ""There will be no learning or otherwise in our house this morning.  ""I need to work out how I'm going to juggle my job and my children's learning again, so I've declared an inset day for us today while I sort it out. ""100% agree schools should close, but it does make it rather stressful when you have to work four days a week while having to support Year 5 and Year 8 children. ""But we did it before, so we'll do it again."" Zoe More said home learning had gone really well in her house so far.  ""School work has been well prepared and delivered by both my children's schools - primary and secondary - and they have both happily completed the work set."" But Cristina Raigada said: ""Home-schooling will be much harder now in winter. Poor kids - school is not childcare, but they miss their friends, the interaction."" The parents' group, Us for Them, said it was ""really disappointed"" by the government's decision to shut schools. Co-founder Molly Kingsley said: ""School closures are a blunt, indiscriminate measure of unproven effectiveness in relation to transmission levels. ""There are approximately 10 million children in this country and each one of them will be harmed by this decision."" Coronavirus: 'Home-schooling has been hell'Covid fears prompt rise in home schooling The parents' group Sept for School is concerned about the ""huge challenge"" that remote learning poses for parents and says it should be kept to a minimum. ""When we asked parents in July 2020 'How has home-schooling been for you?' many were stressed, exhausted and angry,""  said co-founder Fiona Forbes. She said that when schools closed in March 2020, the majority of pupils did not go back into the classroom for six months.  ""That simply cannot be allowed to happen this time. ""Government needs to work collaboratively with the sector to find a way to safely reopen schools and education must be prioritised when lockdown eases.  ""We cannot be in a position again where you can go to the pub and to Primark but our children can't go to school."" How will you be affected by the latest developments?

Covid-19: How parents plan to tackle lockdown home-schooling," Parents and children are beginning home-learning after the latest lockdown measures saw schools closed to most pupils. How will they cope and what did they learn from last time? For the Humphries family in Norwich, structure was the key to ""survival"" during the first coronavirus lockdown in March.  Mum-of-three Liz Humphries, 42, says: ""First time around, it was a case of the schools catching up, everyone was blindsided and I felt like I was making it up off the cuff until they got a handle on it. ""Then I turned our dining room into a school room and I tried to give the children structure."" She adds: ""When I was making it up, it was mayhem so I made them get up at a normal time, get dressed and get started at the same time, and we were following the school break and lunch times.  ""[Personal trainer] Joe Wicks was a godsend and I made them all do PE and I made sure we got out every day as staying inside was driving us crazy. ""This time, we could all see it coming. I did have a couple of panicky days over Christmas because I knew what was coming and what it was like the first time."" The freelance writer says last time she did it ""day by day"" with a ""survival technique"", and she remembers ""being overwhelmed"" by social media and the resources available: virtual tours, singing, science experiments. ""Everything we experienced the first time, I'm basically applying that again but with a bit more structure,"" says Mrs Humphries, who has sons Joshua, 12, and Nathaniel, two, and daughter Madeleine, nine. She says this time, as her eldest son found it difficult to concentrate with his younger brother around, he has set up his workspace in the utility room with his dad Marc. Meanwhile, Madeleine is set up on her school's online learning programme, which means Mrs Humphries has more time to spend with toddler Nathaniel. ""My top tip would be not to get overwhelmed with everything that is available and set up a structure,"" she says. A more relaxed approach works better in the Colbourn household.  Hannah Colbourn, who has daughters Mollie, 10, and Nell, seven, says they all started ""enthusiastically"" with a ""full-on timetable"" and packed lunches as normal.  ""But that lasted for all of three days,"" she says. ""The novelty wore off and the amount of work that we were doing gradually petered off.  ""If we managed an hour of school work a day, I considered that a success."" Mollie goes to Avenue Junior School in Norwich while Nell goes to nearby Recreation Infant School - both of which Mrs Colbourn says were ""brilliant"" and she ""can't praise them highly enough"". She says the schools sent through lots of ideas, but also said the ""most important thing was for the children to be happy"". ""That was a really turning point for me and became my mantra: if they are well and happy, that's the most important thing,"" says the self-employed dog walker.  Schools closed 'with heaviest of hearts' says Gove'Nothing more we can do to make school safer' Covid-19 school U-turn 'like Vicar of Dibley' Mrs Colbourn, 41, says she let her daughters take the lead on what they wanted to learn that day.  They had starlings nesting in their roof so spent one day out in the garden learning more about them and other birds, for example, she says. ""That's the big difference this time - we can't spend as much time outside in the garden and that is bit of a worry,"" she says. ""But overall I'm coming into it a little bit more relaxed. It will be OK and we are all in the same boat. ""As long as they are doing something and they are happy, that's the main thing."" Former teacher Katrin Oldridge, who runs parenting community website Norwich Mumbler, says it is important for mums and dads not to be too harsh on themselves and not to set their expectations too high.  The mother-of-three says: ""Schools are not expecting parents to be teachers and to teach their children everything they would've learnt at school. Do what you can and don't worry. ""It needs to be whatever works for you, some people love a routine and love having a structure while some people like seeing how it goes.  ""And even if you have a structure but something else comes up or it doesn't go to plan, don't worry about it. If you are making sure everyone is feeling happy, that's all you can do."" Mrs Oldridge, who lives in Sprowston, near Norwich, with her husband Andy and their children Ada, six, Hazel, three, and Remy, one, says while the sunny weather in the first lockdown was a ""saviour"", people should not shy away from venturing outdoors.  And even when parents are feeling like ""everything is going wrong"" and are ""finding home-schooling too much"", they they need to remember ""to be kind"" to themselves. ""You can't pour from an empty cup, you have to make sure you are OK before doing anything else,"" she says. ""I set myself two targets during the last lockdown to drink more water and to stretch more - having a little self-care target that wasn't hard to achieve, even with three kids, really helped."" In the Sorrell household, they have rearranged furniture in their Thorpe St Andrew home, on the edge of Norwich, ready for seven-year-old Oliver's home learning. Dad Paul says he and his wife Eleanor found it difficult last time balancing home-schooling the Hillside Avenue Primary School pupil while looking after their three-year-old son Mack, while both working from home. They ended up working reduced hours to fit it all in.  The 49-year-old, who works for the Environment Agency, says: ""The attention span is much different at home than in the classroom and it's a strange environment at home and trying to teach, and I'm not a teacher, but the school was understanding and had set up all of the online resources he needed. ""In the end, rather than trying to do all the different subjects, we decided to concentrate on spelling and maths and when he went back to school, he had done really well and it didn't have a negative effect on him."" Mr Sorrell says he is not as nervous this time around.  ""The first time we were all getting a bit stressed after a few weeks but you can't have a home environment like that,"" he says. ""If we don't do as much as is required, it's going to be alright, we are not going to stress about it."" He adds: ""The biggest worry is that you are not going to do the right thing by your children but keeping that anxiety and stress down is the most important thing - children are incredibly resilient, they bounce back.""

Covid-19: 'Living with 50 people has been a blessing'," A farming community of 50 people who all live together said their way of life had ""come into its own"" during the coronavirus pandemic. The group, which dates back to 1974, share a house in East Bergholt, Suffolk, where they live off 70 acres (28 hectares) of land. They said they had seen a large rise in applications to join them recently. Community member David Hodgson said it had been a ""blessing"" to live there and share their skills during the crisis. ""Within our group we have an incredible set of skills that are put to use for the benefit of us all,"" the 71-year-old added. The community had managed to stay Covid-free by working together and being ""careful and vigilant"", he said. Several of its members are classed as vulnerable, including one resident who is 99 years old. 'Au pairs are a practical solution to a problem'Paddleboarder 'falls in love again' with hometownLockdown band working with Bond film composer They decided to introduce their own social restrictions early in March, ahead of the national lockdown later that month, and have held regular meetings to work out how best to protect themselves. Singing, yoga and philosophy groups which are usually open to the public have all been paused and they have imposed a strict cleaning rota. Social distancing had been relatively easy due to the amount of space they have, with their self-sufficient lifestyle well suited to a lockdown, David said. They said there had been a 300% increase in applications to join the community during the pandemic.  Members buy a share and pay an annual charge to live there. Most also have part-time jobs in the outside world, but must commit to about 15 hours of work a week in the house and its grounds. They breed sheep and pigs, grow fruit, vegetables and wheat for bread, milk their own cows and make butter, cheese and yoghurt. They also generate their own heat and electricity.  During the first lockdown, the members made face masks and opened their own tuck shop, while holding meditation sessions and enjoying socially-distanced campfire meals and maypole dancing. ""If something is needed from the shop or the pharmacy in the village then the request goes out on social media and someone in the community will take up the action,"" David noted in his blog about life there during the first lockdown. The community said it kept tight rules in place throughout the summer, despite the national easing of restrictions. David said: ""We cautiously allowed some potential members to visit the community and some friends and family between lockdown one and two.  ""To accommodate this, we cleared a sheltered area under some trees, constructed a compost toilet and a temporary field kitchen so that our families could camp.  ""Stays were limited to three nights. This enabled us to see family without letting them into the building."" The 16th Century manor house, which has more than 100 rooms, has also been a convent, an army barracks and a Franciscan friary before it was bought in 1974 by 14 families who formed the community.  David worked in architecture before he moved there in 1989. He brought up two children and worked locally three days a week as a design lecturer to supplement his lifestyle.  He retired early to spend most of his time working in the orchards and vegetable gardens.  He said members were looking forward to Christmas, and would have a socially-distanced meal on Christmas Day. ""The children here are enjoying daily advent activities running up to Christmas. Anything from a treasure hunt to biscuit-making to decoration-making workshops,"" he said. He said they would not let their guards down over the festive period and would continue to protect each other, acknowledging that Covid was ""by no means over"" despite the start of the national vaccination programme.

A family's Brexit worries over childcare," For more than 50 years, young Europeans have been crossing the sea to Britain to become au pairs. But with the UK's imminent departure from the European Union and impending changes to immigration laws, there are fears the system is under threat. Au pairing originated in Europe with an agreement between European nations signed in 1969 regulating placements. The reciprocal arrangement allowed au pairs to work short stays of between three and 12 months, often attending a language school, with their board and lodgings covered by the host family.  They perform childcare duties and do light household tasks but are not allowed to work more than 30 hours a week, for which they are paid an average of about Â£90 a week to cover personal expenses.  More than 44,000 British families rely on having an au pair every year, according to the British Au Pair Agencies Association (BAPAA). But, as it stands, the government has no dedicated visa route for au pairs and after Britain leaves the EU, the freedom of movement European au pairs currently enjoy will be lost.  How will it affect those who rely on the programme?  The Barnes family from Ipswich have relied on the au pair system since 2014. Dennis and Lilli work shifts and they have no family nearby, so the programme gives them the flexibility they need for childcare arrangements for their 11-year-old daughter Melody. They are currently hosting their eleventh au pair - Pauline Bremont from Blois in France, who has been with them since September. Mr Barnes, a train driver, says the system enabled his wife to train as a nurse, which she has now been for four years.  With the EU Settlement Scheme, available to those from Europe already in the UK, they know they can continue to host Pauline until August.  But beyond that, they fear Mrs Barnes may have to reduce her hours or even give up her job. Politics East: Your Brexit questions answeredPort in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loomBrexit will bring 'sharp drop' in au pairs Mr Barnes says: ""We always need nurses so we don't like the thought of withdrawing services in an important profession because of childcare. ""You've got somebody at home when your shifts are extended, so, without that, key workers like ourselves - we're stuffed. ""Au pairing is a practical solution to a big problem."" Mr Barnes says over the years they have had a ""great time"" with their au pairs, and have been invited to previous ones' weddings or over to their homes in France.  ""Melody has had a big sister in the house, she is an only child so that's been nice, it's been good all round,"" he adds. Melody said: ""She cooks really well - pancakes and chocolate cakes. And she's funny."" Living with the Barnes family is Pauline, a 22-year-old Strasbourg university project design student and it is her first placement as an au pair.  ""It's a good experience to discover all of the traditions and to improve my English,"" she says.  ""It will help with my CV and it's a good experience for meeting people."" Pauline says English is ""very important"" for her to work in graphic design because ""we need to talk with many people to make a project, in another country, for example"".  She says it will be ""very bad"" if others like her do not get the same opportunity.  BAPAA has been lobbying the government for visa rights for au pairs since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. And while the Home Office says ""there are a number of ways in which au pairs can work in the UK"", BAPAA argues they are not enough.  The Home Office says those from Europe who are already here can join ""the millions who have secured their rights through the EU Settlement Scheme"". It says in addition to the new points-based immigration system, for those from around the world wishing to come to the UK, ""the generous Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) welcomes approximately 20,000 migrants a year, with capacity within existing quotas for approximately 15,000 more migrants"". It says the UK currently has YMS arrangements with Australia, Canada, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, San Marino and Taiwan. But according to BAPAA, the large majority of au pairs come from Europe.  Furthermore, under YMS, those entering the UK have to prove they have Â£2,530 in savings and they are not limited to au pairing. BAPAA chairwoman Jamie Shackell says tens of thousands of British families will struggle without support for the au pair system between Europe and the UK. ""Families have said they might have to give up work and claim benefits because they cannot afford to have a nanny, and breakfast and afternoon clubs don't work if you work shifts,"" she says. ""We are flummoxed by it all. It's a mutually-beneficially cultural exchange programme. ""They are not a financial strain on the UK state - we don't understand why the government won't put forward an au pair visa."" There is a petition calling to ""save au pairs"" that has been signed by almost 28,000 people. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Inner-city teacher beats Olympians as 'sailor of the decade'," An inner-city teacher who led a team of teenagers to compete in one of sailing's toughest races has beaten Olympic stars to the title of International Sailor of the Decade.  Jon Holt started the sailing programme at Greig City Academy, London, in 2014, with an old yacht bought on eBay.  The school is the only comprehensive to have competed in the Fastnet race. Olympians Sir Ben Ainslie and Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson were also shortlisted for the award.  Mr Holt also saw off sailing heroes Sir Robin Knox-Johnston and Dee Caffari, both known for historic voyages around the globe non-stop and single-handed.  The accolade, from the Yachting Journalists Association together with insurers MS Amlin, recognises sailors who have had the greatest positive impact on the sport.  State school crew makes Fastnet historyState school makes waves at Fastnet  The award was decided by a vote of sailing journalists. Mr Holt described it as ""extraordinary - because I saw the list of who was on there and I think that we all do different things within sailing but they have achieved so much"". ""It's quite a shock actually,"" he said. ""They are my idols within sailing. ""I have grown up watching documentaries about what they do."" From a single yacht, which took a whole summer to make seaworthy, the academy now has a fully fledged sailing programme, after school, at weekends and in the holidays.  Determined fundraising produced substantial sponsorship and the school was able to buy and renovate Scaramouche, a 45ft (13.7m) Admiral's Cup yacht built in 1981.  And it was on Scaramouche that a team of teenagers from north London really made headlines, making Greig City Academy the first comprehensive school ever to enter the gruelling Fastnet race, coming 144th out of 362 starters in 2017. They took part again in 2019. ""We are showing people what can be done,"" Mr Holt said.  ""We're showing that you can get into the sport and join the existing structures which are there, if you just dare to try - and that is what we have done.""",BBC News - Family & Education,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 13:06:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-55260558
Coronavirus: How did your lockdown container garden grow?," Vegetable-growing was big news during the first lockdown, with people inspired to get green-fingered in the tiniest of spaces but did they produce bumper crops or snacks for snails?  Joining the lockdown veg-growing boom with no gardenWill coronavirus food worries mean more home-grown veg? ""With cooking, if it goes wrong you can try again the next night,"" says Newcastle based Mark Ridsdill Smith who runs the container gardening forum, Vertical Veg. But with growing ""you have to wait a whole year before you can go again"". In June, Sheila Brand had big ambitions for her third-floor balcony.   She had already picked raspberries, radishes and courgettes and was growing tomatoes, aubergines, herbs and even pumpkins which she hoped to harvest in October.   But then the snails arrived. ""They ate everything. There was nothing left out of all the pumpkins I had sown and grown,"" she said. She was heartbroken but will try again in the spring, although she's not sure how to ward off another ""huge invasion"". ""Right now I'm not growing much at all, just the standard herbs just outside my door for easy access while I'm cooking... ""My balcony looks very sad,"" she says. Mark's advice: There are loads of anti-snail products, but really the best way is to go out at night with a torch and spend five minutes picking them off. Alternatively, look under pots or in other shady places and remove them in daylight.  For real-ale enthusiast Colin Coyne it began when his sister gave him six pots containing tiny tomato seedlings.  His second floor flat has no outside space so they sat on his living room window sill, inside the glass, in perfect greenhouse conditions. Colin, who chairs the north London branch of the Campaign for Real Ale, made sure they were well watered. By July, the tomato plants were nearly 2m high. At night, they pushed out the curtains, by day they blocked out the light. He propped them up, at first on canes and later on strings attached to the curtain pole.    ""They grew and they grew and they grew... When you're dealing with a forest, eventually I had to cut them back,"" he says.  Despite an influx of aphids all the plants produced fruit and Colin ate a lot of tomato salad.  ""It's encouraged me to try again, I've certainly got the bug,"" he said, although next year he plans to stick to smaller plants like  basil, thyme or sage. He's also saved seeds from a chilli plant which was his other crop, although he's not convinced by the flavour: ""It nearly blew my head off,"" he says.  Mark's advice: Not all tomato plant varieties are enormous. Look for varieties labelled ""balcony"" or ""tumbling"" which might be a better fit. Herbs like basil or thyme would do very well in such a warm location. Chilli plants are a good idea but try a milder variety.  With aphids, he says, it's about managing the population. Smaller plants can be taken outside, turned upside down, tapped a few times and the aphids will jump off. Otherwise, just squish them, he says. Healthcare worker Hana Evans can see the sea from her balcony flat in Paignton, Devon, and is hoping her lettuce, rocket, kale and spinach will provide fresh greens all winter.  In the summer, she also grew several types of tomato, radishes, peas, beans, cucumbers, herbs and courgettes .  ""The plants created a true edible jungle... It's truly been my little retreat and a sanctuary of peace."" Her high-rise garden attracted ""bees and butterflies"" and ""a family of goldfinches"" which fed on seeds from the cornflowers she grew.  But packing in so much had a downside: ""The plants have been competing for space and light a bit which eventually brought in a few pests,"" and her courgettes never reached full size although they were ""delicious small"".  Mark's advice: Plant spacing is partly trial and error and it's definitely worth giving fruiting plants like courgettes a bit more room. ""I think she's done an amazing job."" Richard Chamberlain's four south-west-facing window ledges have seen prolific growth, first with kale and spring onions and then replanted with tomatoes and courgettes which are still ""steadily producing"". An experienced gardener who grew up on a fruit and veg farm in Essex, Richard's career as a business consultant has taken him to Florida and California where vegetables ""just whoosh"".  He checks on the plants at the start of each day but ""I don't talk to them,"" he says.  He would do some things differently next year.  ""The kale was OK. There were about eight plants. I made the mistake of not harvesting as soon as I should have done... ""I actually cooked some and tried to eat it but the stalks were too woody in the mouth."" Mark says: Kale varieties like cavalo nero and red Russian can be tender enough to eat uncooked, he says, but plants can become bitter or woody if they dry out. So be extra careful in hot, dry weather, particularly with small pots, which can dry out fast.  Robyn Wiles and her partner Alex improvised by using wooden pallets hung on the walls of their patio in Nottingham as planters to grow chillies, peppers, tomatoes, spring onions, and herbs. The chillies went into stir fries ""and have a surprising kick for such little things"", while the tomatoes and spring onions ""have been lovely in our lunch salads and we made fresh pesto with our basil"".  Robyn has less time for gardening now she's back working full-time as a physiotherapist but hopes to try again next year, ideally expanding from pallets into pots for more growing room.  Mark says: If you're short of time, larger containers can be a boon as they retain moisture which means missing a day's watering won't be a disaster.  Also, think about perennial, rather than annual plants. Unlikely perennials for containers include blackberries and blueberries and ""you can get a purple raspberry that does well"", plus oregano or sage and more unusual herbs like lovage or savory. Mark even has a container-grown apple tree, which produces about 100 apples each year. His main advice when things go wrong is not to lose heart and to accept that learning might be slow.  ""A little bit of the right information can make all the difference. ""When I started off I had loads of things go wrong, loads of disasters but it's all part of the fun.""

The tech allowing exams to be taken at home," The phones began ringing off the hook at Piero Tintori's company Better Examinations back in April. His tech business allows tens of thousands of students to remotely sit exams at the same time, with each needing just a laptop, a webcam and an internet connection. The firm's software uses machine learning (ML), an advanced form of artificial intelligence, to detect patterns in user behaviour that could indicate attempts to cheat. Its technology can also automatically mark multiple-choice answers and mathematics exams. In addition, it checks each exam-sitter's identity using the webcam, to ensure that no-one else is sitting the test for them. The Better Examinations program also temporarily restricts access to the internet, or certain websites and applications on each person's computer. ""We had 60 organisations from all over the world contact us out of the blue, who wanted to run exams online in May and June,"" says Mr Tintori. ""Everything from universities, to professional organisations, to schools."" With the firm's headquarters in Dublin, plus offices in the US, Australia and Poland, it uses Amazon's cloud computing system Amazon Web Services, to allow everything to work online. Mr Tintori says he was also contacted directly by five governments (whom he declines to name), who were keen for school exams to go ahead. The AI that spots Alzheimer's from cookie drawing Better Examinations is just one example of the increased use of ML in response to this year's pandemic, with the technology being used to do work far more quickly than humans, such as marking exam papers. But what exactly is ML? It is a method of data analysis, whereby computer algorithms are used to speedily process vast amounts of data, to make predictions, identify patterns and replicate actions that humans do in their day-to-day jobs.   The use of ML is expected to grow so much over the next four years that its estimated global economic value is expected to rise from $7.3bn (Â£5.7bn) this year, to $30.6bn in 2024, according to one study. Global law firm DWF, which helps the in-house legal teams of large corporations, is another business now increasingly using the technology. It was approached by a large real estate company that had an ""impossible"" task. The client wanted 10,000 property lease documents, stored on paper and electronically, and in different locations, to be digitalised into a central database. This firm also wanted to know the exact terms of each of the leases, to discover new commercial opportunities. ""Traditionally, you would get paralegals under supervision to plough through the documents. But from a cost point of view it doesn't work, and also it's inconsistent,"" says Mark Qualter, chief executive of DWF's managed services division.  DWF designed an ML system to classify each lease document into categories, identify specific types of details, and then extract data from the document.  The banking sector is also embracing ML. UK building society Nationwide had asked US computer giant IBM to build an artificial intelligence ""chatbot"" called Arti for it, to help first-time buyers understand how to get a mortgage. But when the UK went into its first lockdown in March, and mortgage holidays were announced, the lender was instead inundated with queries about them. In just four days, Arti - powered by AI platform IBM Watson - was retrained to answer mortgage holiday questions. The virtual agent also dealt with other questions as Nationwide saw online banking registrations jump by 89%. ""In just over two months, Arti had responded to more than 10,000 queries, and a further 350 per day since, freeing up hundreds of hours for frontline teams to focus their time handling more complex requests from members,"" says Michael Conway, UK lead for artificial intelligence at IBM Services. ""Put simply, it allowed Nationwide to focus its resources on those who needed the most help, without ignoring the needs of everyone else."" Meanwhile, another UK retail bank has been using ML algorithms to identify customers who are showing indications of financial difficulty, so that they can be contacted automatically, and then offered support before matters get out of hand. This has been provided to the lender by BJSS, a multinational technology engineering consultancy headquartered in Leeds. Sri Harsha Tharkabhushanam, head of data science for BJSS, says that previously of those in arrears, 30% had got to a severe position where ""there was very little the bank could do for them at that point"". But after implementing the ML model, the automated prompts meant fewer people were getting into severe difficulties, with the figure falling to 10%. Business intelligence gathering using AI is also becoming a big deal.  For instance, a large European pharmaceutical firm, which wants to remain anonymous, wanted to make sure that if there was a new product launched, or start-up bought, by any of their competitors, it knew about it quickly. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. The company employed Filament AI, a machine-learning software firm in London, to build it a bespoke ML system that could monitor 1,000 websites, 200 story feeds, and roughly 200,000 news articles a day round the clock. Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning at Oxford University, says that companies across many industries are now ""desperately trying to get their hands on ML"", as many more things are now being quantified digitally, making it easier to analyse them to gain insights. Martha White, associate professor of computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada, agrees that the use of ML is growing fast. ""The combination of more data, and more powerful computers, and a focus on leveraging both has really propelled the field forward,"" she says. ""The prevalence will continue to grow for a few reasons. Firstly, there is still lots of low-hanging fruit, and the ability to monetise with the existing technology. Secondly, we are going to get better at improving our own decision making, using predictions from machine-learning systems."" But although ML is becoming increasingly popular, there are concerns it has been oversold as a ""magic wand"", and the public's distrust of it is only rising, warns Prof Osborne. ""ML is not this all-singing, all-dancing solution to our woes,"" he says. ""Instead it's something that delivers value only when working hand-in-hand with humans, and having humans tailor it to their specific needs. ""ML is powerful, but not a fully general-purpose technology. It needs a lot of careful tweaking to get it to work for any new application.""",BBC News - Family & Education,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:05:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54881746
Covid and schools: 'Children know things aren't right'," Teachers have warned of a ""collapse"" in secondary school attendance after the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn. Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate. What impact is that having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams? Even before mid-October, when Northern Ireland's ""huge wave"" of cases came to Lisneal College in Londonderry, principal Michael Allen says about five of the GCSE year group of 135 pupils had not returned because of mental health and anxiety issues. He says the impact of self-isolation was to reduce overall attendance to below 85%. At that level, for an individual student, the school would normally refer families to education welfare services, Mr Allen says. âCollapseâ in secondary school attendance warningClose schools early for Christmas, says union What's happening with next year's exams? The first case meant 60 pupils in year 12 - Northern Ireland's GCSE exam year - had to go into self-isolation, just weeks before exams started in November. ""We have just had 20 Year 12s return from two weeks of self-isolation, and at 9.30am many of those young people had to walk into an exam hall and sit a single-award GCSE chemistry exam,"" Mr Allen said. There is ""total and utter disregard"" for the disadvantage pupils like this face in the exam system, he says, with pupils with special education needs being especially badly affected. Remote teaching is made harder because teachers cannot work simultaneously with pupils in the classroom and those working at home. ""That's not living in the real world,"" Mr Allen said. The work of contact tracing falls to school leaders themselves, meaning they have to respond to sudden alerts of positive cases at any time. Mr Allen said pupils give him or his vice-principal a ""look of dread"" when they walk into the classroom, because they know it means someone will end up missing school. Some have begged them to review the contact tracing process. ""Two weeks ago we had a girl in tears asking us to go back and measure the two metres. No one seems to be taking any notice of what these young people are going through."" ""It's been a bit of a nightmare"", said Emily Proffitt of the asymptomatic spread that forced her to temporarily close Cooper Perry Primary School in Staffordshire on the advice of public health officials. First, a staff member tested positive over half-term, forcing a few others to self-isolate. Then a few days later another member of the team tested positive. But there was no traceable connection to other positive cases, so public health authorities said all the staff at the small village school - which has open-plan teaching spaces - needed to be tested. That eventually uncovered another three asymptomatic cases. By that point so many staff had to self-isolate that the school was forced to close for a week. They reopened this week, only for a pupil to test positive, meaning two year groups and five members of staff were sent home. ""For the parents, I feel so sorry for them,"" Ms Proffitt said. With several pupils having had four weeks out of school since half-term, some of their parents will have had to take time off work. For some of them, they will have been unpaid. She said she was worried it looked like the school had not prepared for the risk, when in reality ""we've got hands that are red-raw from sanitising"".  Pupils are anxious, with some asking to wear masks even when they are not required. Staff are working in isolation from each other and are stressed, as many prepare two sets of lessons for in-person and remote teaching, Ms Proffitt said. ""We're looking at probably a decade of attachment and trauma issues that are going to be related back to Covid.""   ""However much we paint our smiles on in the classroom, and we're good at that, children read us very well and they know things aren't quite right."" Merseyside has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic.  And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer. One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life. ""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school."" He says the year group is still learning content that they had missed when schools were closed in the first lockdown. ""In any other time period we would be revising and going over past things now."" ""I don't really think it's fair,"" he said, pointing out that some areas have seen much more disruption to education in this wave of the virus, while everyone will face the same exam conditions. ""We've obviously all gone through Covid and it's been strange for everyone. But there are other places it hasn't affected as much as here,"" he says. Felicity Sandford said her daughter Cerys was the only one in her form to be sent home after contact with another child in her Spanish class who had tested positive. ""She was a bit traumatised to be pulled out of her class and not know what was going on, and she was the only one,"" Felicity said.  Students were reassured they had not done anything wrong but had to wait a while before they learned why they were being taken out of class. ""I had to go and meet her and she was pretty upset."" Felicity said she was ""absolutely gutted"" herself as her work as a marketing consultant for children's activity providers in west London was hitting a busy time. But she says it was a ""pleasant surprise"" how organised the remote learning has been, with Cerys using Microsoft Teams to keep in touch, taking online lessons from Oak National Academy and logging her homework and progress with photographs. ""In lockdown, at primary school there wasn't any structure. With this one I haven't had to get very involved,"" Felicity says. The strict remote learning regime surprised Cerys too, who had hoped ""she might just get to chill out in her pyjamas"" only to find that her schedule of work had been emailed the night before. But with both parents working from home, finding space in the house has been one of the main challenges. ""I've actually been working from her bedroom today while she's been at the dining table,"" says Felicity. Tasos Konidaris says his daughter Mathilde took it ""quite heavily"" when she was told by her school she needed to self-isolate because of contact with a student who tested positive. A year 11 student, Mathilde already felt unprepared because of missed classes during the pandemic's first wave, Tasos says. ""She thinks, how am I going to deal with this? Is it fair?"" He says the school adapted well to online classes with students able to watch most lessons remotely.  But eventually the whole year had to isolate as the case load became too great. And when his daughter tested positive, the family had to self-isolate too. With sons Hector, 13, and Alexander, 10, also learning from home, it put the parents under extra strain. ""You're having to suddenly be a parent, a teacher and do your work. It's quite wearing,"" he said. But Tasos said it gave them a renewed appreciation of what teachers do.  ""When you have your kids looking you in the eye and telling you with a sad face, I want to go back to school - which is funny to hear from a teenager - it's a tell-tale sign about how important it is.""",BBC News - Family & Education,"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 15:22:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55105275
'What caring for my mum taught me about caring for my son'," At age 13, Penny Wincer was her mother's carer. Today she cares for her autistic son. Both experiences have convinced her society must do much more for those with the responsibility of looking after others. I was around 30 years old, years past my mother's death, when I first heard the term ""young carer"". I had spent much of my teenage years supporting her while she struggled with severe depression and alcoholism. She died by suicide when I was 22. Like many people, I thought the term ""carer"" only applied to those who provided intensive personal care - lifting in and out of bed, bathing and feeding the elderly or dying. I hadn't realised those long evenings spent by her bedside listening to her worries, the extra household duties I took on and all those times I crept into her bedroom after returning from school to check if she was still breathing, were considered caring.  After my son Arthur was diagnosed as autistic when he was three years old, the full weight of my responsibilities as his carer hit me. I was 35 by then. As I lay awake at night, trying to adjust to the reality of this life-changing diagnosis, I was afraid, because I had been here before. Though on the surface the challenges facing my mother and my son couldn't have been more different, I knew what it was to hold someone else's life in my hands. The responsibility can be overwhelming. And yet, I had done it before. Many unpaid family carers struggle with the word ""carer"". Some have told me that the word makes them feel as though they are the rescuer and their loved one a victim, which is not reflective of their relationship at all. The word itself often conjures up images of parents and children, or the very elderly. One woman in her 30s told me that it felt as though describing her husband as her carer eclipsed their relationship as husband and wife. The way the word is used often implies that it is uni-directional, as though the care only goes from carer to the person needing support - when in reality care very often goes both ways.  Listen to Penny Wincer speaking on BBC Radio 4's Four ThoughtYou can also download the podcast We as a society still largely portray disability to be a sad and bad thing. Stories about it are told through the lens of non-disabled writers and artists, who imagine being disabled to be the worst thing that could happen to you. It's a narrative that still looms large across the media, in personal family histories and in the whispered ""I'm so sorry"" and pitying looks when a disability is disclosed. In this world, where disabled people must still fight for even the most basic of rights, to be a carer is not a high-status position. And just like so much of the work that has traditionally been seen as feminine, care work is either low-paid or unpaid, and low-status. As I adjusted to my son's diagnosis and the unknown future for both him and me, I realised that contrary to my initial fears, we were living a very happy life. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that I am as happy as anyone I know.  Our family life can be complicated and challenging. Everyday things that are quite straightforward for many families - play dates, family gatherings, a summer holiday, accessing education - these can often be extremely difficult for us. But somewhere along the way, I came to realise that our challenges (of which there are many) do not prevent us from having a full life. It turns out, you don't need fluent speech to have loving relationships, and far from making our lives miserable, some of the restrictions we live with mean a simplicity that many modern families crave and struggle to achieve. It was in this realisation that I knew that my initial fears were partly due to a mismatch between expectations and reality. As humans, we often have a lot of expectations and they are not always conscious. I had no idea that I expected I would have a child who could speak until I had one who could not. This expectation, that our reality should be other than it is, was a large part of the reason why I found the diagnosis hard at first. When I was able to let go of those expectations, I was freed from many of those worries. There were, however, other very tangible reasons for my concerns about raising a disabled child. We live in a society that still treats people with learning disabilities appallingly. Their stories are rarely told and shared, their lives often very hidden. Some of my fears for my son were well-founded. According to recent research, his life is likely to be up to 20 years shorter than the lives of his non-disabled peers, simply because he has a moderate learning disability.  I have had to fight hard for an appropriate education for him. I am constantly struggling to get him access to things like occupational therapy, which improves his life enormously. And like most families that look like ours, getting enough respite to ensure that I am rested and I can earn a living to support my family is a constant fight. Unlike parents of non-disabled children, I am truly in this for the long haul and I will need to be well enough, and financially stable enough, to support my son indefinitely. If I separated out these very real fears from the imagined, what I saw was that it was largely society that was the problem, not my son's disability. And as his carer, the same is true for me. When the support is right, carers and the people they support can thrive. Of all the carers I have spoken with, not one of them told me they wished someone else would do it instead of them. But most of them said they needed more help, more breaks, more co-operation and less fighting for their loved one's basic rights. Instead many feel abandoned, used as a money-saving option - they're asked to go above and beyond what any professional would be asked to do, and are required to burn out before being offered anything near appropriate support. It is a short-termism that is dangerous to both the person needing support and the carer themselves. If we as carers are not well, at some point we will no longer be able to provide any support at all.  One of the greatest gifts that came from supporting my mother was a deep understanding of the importance of self-care. She became unwell when I was around 11 years old. By the time I was 13 she was having regular stints in psychiatric units and struggling to leave her bedroom, often for weeks at a time. Over the following years we spoke a lot about her illness and she had many regrets. She wished she had paid attention to herself earlier. The reasons for my mother's illness were complicated, of course, but she had put herself at the bottom of the pile for a long time and she felt that was, at least in part, the reason her illness spiralled so out of control when it did. She made me promise that I wouldn't make the same mistake, that I would listen to my body, that I would claim space for myself when I was a mother. It was a lesson I have not forgotten.  I believe my mother was correct. If you, as a main caregiver, suffer, everyone suffers. When we have someone so very dependent on us, we have a duty to care for ourselves. There is no room for martyrs. We must learn to fight (if we must) for the rest we need, to be able to continue to earn a living and to have lives that stretch beyond our roles as carers. To make our own needs clear, so that they don't become completely lost.  Continuing to work has been one way in which I have looked after myself. I'm very fortunate that I enjoy my work a lot, but it goes beyond that. In earning my own living I have autonomy, I can save for retirement, I can afford more support for myself and my son and I have the money I need to help us make the world a little more accessible for Arthur. It can cost up to three times as much to raise a disabled child as a non-disabled child and this is exacerbated by the fact that most mothers of disabled children have to give up work. Only 16% do any kind of paid work at all and only 4% work full time. There just isn't the adequate support for families in our position and it is mothers who pay the long-term financial price.  When I speak to other carers, I often hear a sense of guilt in their voices that they have any needs at all.  Part of the reason it can be so difficult talking about caring is because we have to admit we aren't always great at it. We get tired, we get frustrated and we get lonely. But meeting those needs can be too difficult. How do we follow advice to get some sleep when the person we support needs us throughout the night? How do we get adequate exercise when we can barely leave the house? How do we keep up with friends when we so often have to say no? This is where the term ""self-care"", I think, is inadequate. The responsibility should not be ours alone, more things we must add to that never-ending to-do list. It is our collective responsibility to care for the carers. We cannot and should not be expected to do it alone.  Never has this been more apparent than this year. In March, at the beginning of lockdown, many of the estimated 6.5 million carers lost most or all of their support overnight. A report by Carers UK has found that 70% of carers increased the amount of care they were providing over lockdown and the majority said they felt overwhelmed and fearful they would experience burnout. When local services and schools close and when paid carers cannot work, it is the unpaid carers who pick up all those responsibilities, often alone. This year has been more challenging than any since my son's diagnosis. I, like many carers I have spoken to, have felt a sense of grief akin to those early days, when I felt so overwhelmed that I was afraid it would swallow me whole. As a family, we are incredibly dependent on the outside world. My son's school provides far more than education. It is where he receives support and therapy beyond what I, as a single parent, can provide. Our paid carers who come in to support us do far more than allow me to work. Their presence means our world is larger and more accessible for my son. We are a family very much dependent on the support of our community. Without it I fear what is needed from me will overwhelm me. The current crisis is far from over, and it is one that came on top of a social care crisis that was already growing. Carers need more tangible support. But though that may be outside of our immediate control, what we can give ourselves right now, is compassion. Compassion, as we find ourselves exhausted and worried for our own health. Space to allow ourselves to say: ""It's OK to find it hard."" Permission to feel grief over the losses we are experiencing - the loss of respite, of proper rest and the loss of all those hard-fought-for services that could disappear again at any moment.  The act of caring for another human reveals many paradoxes. The loss of one expected future can reveal another that is perhaps more challenging and yet richer than we could have imagined. That the act of care itself can be both fulfilling as well as incredibly lonely. We revel in seemingly tiny gains and it can give us a fresh perspective on what it means to live a good life. When my son achieves a milestone that his peers have reached years before, we understand just how miraculous human development is - and celebrate accordingly. There is always so much to be grateful for. Caring can also make us face up to our biggest fears, whether that's because it will end in the death of someone we love, or because it will only end when we die, and our loved one will have to go on without our support.  When we amplify the voices of disabled people, we can help make the world more accessible for all. And when we share our stories as carers, we allow those around us to step up and support us in the often-intense job of caring for someone we love.

Like hundreds of thousands of other young carers, she took on major responsibilities early - and she says it was the defining experience of her life.

Cut off in lockdown: 'Only left home three times since March'," Millions might feel lonely in the lockdown, but every type of loneliness is individual. Here are five very different ways of living with loneliness. A photograph of fish and chips was one way that Liz Grint tried, in a symbolic way, to tackle a sense of loneliness and separation. She is a carer for her husband, Carl, who is 73 and has multiple health problems - and he has only been able to leave their home three times since March. The couple, living near Norwich and married for 48 years, have reshaped their lives during the pandemic, with almost eight months of isolation so far. ""Everyday life is totally different now. ""People say it must be so tough on you - but I've got so used to doing it,"" says 68-year-old Liz. Beating loneliness Millions of people, young and old, are facing loneliness, isolation and separation during the lockdown. A BBC News project on TV, radio and online reveals some of their stories and how they are fighting back.

Listen to Ron's adviceMake connections through BBC Local Radio's Make a Difference campaignJoin the BBC's Beating Loneliness Facebook GroupIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised, BBC Action Line has a list of organisations and charities offering advice and support Carers UK has highlighted how carers have been so isolated during the lockdown and cut off from the respite they might badly need. Liz is lonely for the life she is missing: seeing friends, going to church, meeting family, going to the shops. But when she realised how much she was missing going to buy fish and chips, Liz asked friends to go for them and send back a picture. ""So they went down and bought fish and chips, sat on one of the benches and took a photograph of them when they had started eating,"" says Liz. They were having a treat by proxy. She reads, knits and sews to pass the time, but can no longer stand looking at the news and some Zooms just make her feel even more lonely. ""We're just in a little bubble now,"" she says. ""I think we've got resigned to this now. This is what life is all about.  ""In some ways, because of what we've had to do, we're more content - because there's no point wanting anything else. ""What really matters to me is my family, keeping them safe."" ""It feels like the whole world is moving - and you're not,"" says Elorm Fiavor, a young carer looking after her mother in Salford, describing how it feels to be 16 and lonely. ""It's like everything is just going on in my head. My situation is slow, and I'm looking outside and see other people my age and their lives are moving fast and they are having fun,"" says Elorm. Because of her mother's sickle cell anaemia, and the need to shield her, Elorm has had stay inside, missing out on ""that teenage experience of making plans to go out on Saturday"". She's had to face up to being lonely and has become part of a charity project, Lonely Not Alone, that is helping young people to challenge the stigma of loneliness. ""I think I've been forced to grow up,"" she says. Vruti Patel is expecting her first baby. ""I've felt really lonely - I just want another mum to talk to,"" she says. Unable to attend ante-natal classes and working from home, the 33-year-old from London says she's felt cut off from mutual support. If she's worried about her pregnancy, ""I want to hear someone say it's totally normal"". ""Loneliness is a very big issue - but it's not as much talked about. It needs to be brought to light,"" says Vruti. She's turned to technology to connect with other expectant mothers through a social networking app called Peanut. But she thinks the isolation and loneliness of pregnant women during the pandemic needs much more attention. ""It's a much bigger impact than being able to go to the pub,"" says Vruti. Eric Klinenberg, an author and professor at New York University, says loneliness has been changed in the pandemic. ""Has it taken on a new dimension? Sure. But what hasn't?"" says Prof Klinenberg. ""It's a very hard time to be living alone. It's also a very hard time living with other people. It's just a hard time to be living. ""I'm married with kids and I certainly didn't sign up for living in the same house 24/7, fighting over everything all the time."" He argues that being independent and individual brings with it the greater likelihood of being lonely sometimes. ""We've experienced loneliness for a long time - it's a feature of modernity,"" he says. ""Living on your own, you're more isolated anyway,"" says Niall Herron, a 53-year-old living in London, who argues a big city population isn't necessarily a defence against feeling alone. He has suffered from depression and takes conscious steps to avoid loneliness, which he says in the past has been a problem for him. ""A cup of coffee with someone can completely change it,"" he says. ""The lockdown has made me realise we're social animals. We're not meant to be in isolation."" He says that loneliness itself is like a ""separate illness"". Niall is gay and says that while growing up, he faced a lack of acceptance that was a form of loneliness - and he is determined not to allow it to take root in his life now. He is involved in the Oasis church group and does voluntary work a couple of days a week, maintaining connections and keeping around people. Even going to the supermarket can ""lift your spirits"", Niall says. ""You have to be careful with your loneliness.""",BBC News - Family & Education,"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 09:08:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54965454
Making friends across generations," More people are feeling lonely now than at any point during the pandemic, new figures suggest. So with Covid restrictions still in place and winter looming, how can you beat loneliness? The office for national statistics (ONS) spoke to more than 4,000 people in Britain and a quarter said they are always, often or sometimes lonely. That figure rose to more than a third (34%) in 16 to 29 year olds. BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat has been speaking to young people about how they have tackled it - from finding friends online, bonding over Minecraft or simply calling mum. Megan O'Brien says she struggled when she moved cities for university in 2018. ""I wasn't physically alone, but I felt a bit lost so that made me feel lonely,"" Megan tells Newsbeat.  The 21-year-old got a flyer through her door from the charity Together Co, which has a befriending service. She contacted them and was set up with Lil, 79. It wasn't just Lil who benefitted from Megan's weekly visits. ""When you have someone to visit, it takes your mind off things for a bit and you can have a laugh"", Megan says. ""That lifts your mood generally."" The pair now chat for about two hours each week because they can't meet in person due to Covid-19 restrictions. ""We really do get on and we both can chat for hours. ""It's a nice feeling that someone wants your company and enjoys talking to you.""  Samantha Nimmo got pregnant when she was 18 and gave birth at 19.  She says being a teen mum was very lonely as she didn't know anyone her age who was a parent. ""It was really isolating and really lonely - and the pandemic has made that worse.  ""You can't go to new mum groups, baby groups, or even going out for coffee - seeing family was really hard."" The student from Stirling, who's now 20, started writing poetry about her experiences as a new mum and posting it online. ""I post a lot of my work on Instagram - there's a lovely poetry community on there and I've met a few mums on there too."" ""I've met new friends online from it - we Zoom and chat - once the pandemic is over, we can hopefully all meet in person. ""It helps with the feelings of isolation and loneliness."" Matthias Glenday, 21, says he often felt lonely growing up and never really fitted in at school. He met his first gaming friends when he started playing Minecraft at 11. Since then, he's developed a friendship group through gaming and has friends in Texas, Sweden and the UK - and they've met up several times in the flesh too. ""It sounds clichÃ©d, but we're a shoulder to cry on. I know almost everything about all of them.  ""We go through so much together - the passing of loved ones, mental health issues and medical issues.  ""I've got these people at my keyboard and answering in 30 seconds."" He says finding people like him was the key to beating loneliness.  ""There's a lot of people out there feeling lonely - and there's people waiting to make friends."" Moving to a new town, city or country can be a lonely experience.  For Lydia it was made even more difficult because of the pandemic.  The 24-year-old got a new job in Spain in July and struggled to find friends.  Someone she knew recommended the friendship app Bumble BFF. Lydia matched with Anna, also 24, and from the UK. ""We had lunch and and I don't know it just it all felt very comfortable very quickly, which was nice thing.  ""There were no pretences because nobody was trying to sleep with anyone. ""It was just, oh, I need a friend, you need a friend. Let's go and do something together.  ""It was quite relaxed and nice - since then we've of have met every week or so."" Loneliness: The man who talked to chairsCovid: Romance fraudsters 'target lonely' in lockdownHow solitude and isolation can affect your social skillsCovid: Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health Jack Rigby says he experienced loneliness for the first time this year after he broke up with his partner during the pandemic. The 28-year-old had to move house and into a flat on his own, where he worked from home. Then he got Covid-19 and didn't see anyone for two weeks. He says calling his mum always helps. ""I think it's just important to talk about how you're feeling with as many people as possible - and you know, nobody's going to judge you. ""That's what's made a huge difference. ""If I'm having a day where I'm feeling rubbish and it's all getting a bit much, I pick up the phone or log in to Skype, and generally the people  you love and the people who care about you, they're there for those calls."" Nazia Hamidah had her baby daughter during lockdown and found she had little support.  The 29-year-old said being lonely was a ""big factor during lockdown"". ""I did feel really lonely because I didn't have my mum around, as she died two years ago, so that in itself was a big challenge. ""That was compounded by not having my sister or friends around.""  Nazia believes social media can have a positive impact when it comes to loneliness.  ""I started my own 'mummy blog' when my baby was three months old because thought maybe I could reach out to other mums who have also had a baby during lockdown. ""I found it very positive for me and I would encourage any other mums who want to connect to get a sense of community."" ""It's connected me with other mums. ""I gained a sense of community from it that I didn't have before"".  Psychologist Dr Julie Smith has given us her tips for tackling loneliness and helping others. Take loneliness seriously and understand how important real connection is to your mental health.  Make daily human connection a priority, so it helps to make things into a daily ritual. Take an interest in other people. If you struggle with those social skills and knowing what to say, focus on just being curious about the other person.  Get creative. In lockdown, we've obviously got huge limitations around us, so we need to get creative about how to make those connections. Even having dinner over zoom will be a great idea or taking a daily walk with a friend. Reach out to help others, whether you feel lonely or not. The statistics suggest that someone you know will also be lonely, so start conversations to remind people that they matter to you.

Ocean pollutants 'have negative effect on male fertility'," Long-lived banned industrial chemicals may be threatening the fertility of male porpoises living off the UK. Polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) were phased out decades ago, but can build up in whales, dolphins and porpoises. Scientists say harbour porpoises exposed to PCBs had shrunken testicles, suggesting an effect on sperm count and fertility. They say that while these are preliminary findings, more must be done to clean up the oceans. PCBs have been linked with a number of threats to whales and dolphins, but research has focused on mothers and their young. A study led by scientists at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) found high levels of PCBs were linked to smaller testicles in otherwise healthy animals. They think this could have an impact on sperm count, with obvious implications for reproductive success. ""In porpoises, reduced testes weights have been associated with lower sperm counts so we think that if PCBs are reducing testes weights they may also be reducing sperm counts but we hope to do further research to confirm this,"" said lead researcher Rosie Williams of ZSL.  Populations of harbour porpoises around the UK are believed to be stable, though the animals face threats from pollution, accidental fishing and infection. The situation is much more dire for killer whales, which are down to a handful of individuals. PCBs were used widely in industry during the last century in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment. A series of bans were put in place around the world from the 1970s onwards after concerns were raised about toxicity. The chemicals take a long time to break down and can linger in the environment, particularly in landfill sites where they can escape into waterways and on into the sea. PCBs can build up in the marine food chain, affecting dolphins and porpoises. One killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded. 'Shocking' pollutant levels in UK whale Although levels of the chemicals are declining, they take a very long time to disappear entirely. PCBs have been linked with a number of risks to whales and dolphins, particularly in the early stages of life.  A recent study found dolphins living in the English Channel were exposed to a ""cocktail of pollutants"", which are passed down from mother to calf. 'Toxic chemical cocktail' passed to baby porpoises 'Cocktail of pollutants' found in dolphins Scientists think PCB exposure at high levels can cause a number of effects on the animals' immune system, reproductive system and brain. In humans, researchers have found a correlation between high PCB exposure and changes in sperm quality. Strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises happen regularly around the UK coast. The deaths are investigated by scientists from the Cetacean Strandings Investigations Programme to find out more about underlying causes, such as mistaken capture in fishing lines, collisions with boats and infections. In the latest study scientists compared PCBs in blubber and testes weights of more than 250 harbour porpoises that had washed up on the UK coast over the past two decades. The study used testes weight as a measure of male fertility. ""Testes weight has been shown to correlate with other measures of fertility such as sperm production and we found that higher levels of PCBs were associated with lower testes weights,"" said Rosie Williams. Populations of harbour porpoises off the UK have pregnancy rates less than half that of populations in areas less contaminated with PCBs, she said, which may be a result of an impact on both male and female fertility. ""This is the first time that we have investigated and found that PCBs have a negative effect on male fertility,"" she said. ""That's really important because it means that current risk assessments might be underestimating the threat to our marine mammals."" There are particular concerns for predators at the top of the food chain, such as killer whales and bottlenose dolphins, which accumulate the highest levels of PCBs in their blubber. The study, carried out in collaboration with experts at the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme, Brunel University, Exeter University and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), is published in the journal, Environment International.

£3bn UK climate finance to be spent on supporting nature," The UK will spend at least Â£3bn of international climate finance on nature and biodiversity over five years, the Prime Minister has said. Boris Johnson made the announcement in a virtual address to the One Planet Summit for biodiversity in Paris. The PM said the investment was needed to protect nature, including marine life, forests and sustainable food production. Prince Charles has also spoken at the event. In his address, Mr Johnson said humanity is destroying species and habitats at ""an absolutely unconscionable rate"". He said the Â£3bn, which forms part of the UK's Â£11.6bn contribution to a climate finance initiative, would go to ""protecting nature, whether it's marine life or timber conservation or sustainable food production"". Extinction crisis: Leaders say it is time to actBiodiversity: Why the nature crisis matters, in five graphics Programmes supported by the funding will include marine conservation, tackling deforestation and efforts to conserve habitats such as mangroves that protect local communities from the impacts of climate change. The PM added: ""Obviously it's right to focus on climate change, obviously it's right to cut CO2 emissions but we won't achieve a real balance with our planet, unless we protect nature as well."" And he spoke of the pandemic, saying it ""was the product of an imbalance in man's relationship with natural world"", originating from a ""collision between mankind and the natural world"".  The UK is committing to protect 30% of its land and ocean by the end of the decade. Conservation group WWF said it was vital that our financing of nature restoration overseas goes alongside removing the destruction of nature from UK supply chains.  ""As the Environment Bill returns to Parliament this month, the Government has an opportunity to set ambitious new laws to end deforestation, reduce our global footprint and set nature on the path to recovery,"" said Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF. About 30 politicians and opinion leaders addressed the summit, including the Prince of Wales. Prince Charles, who is marking 50 years of environmental campaigning, called on firms to back a more sustainable future and do more to protect the planet.

Climate change: Africa's green energy transition 'unlikely' this decade," Fossil fuels are set to remain the dominant source of electricity across Africa over the next decade, according to a new study. Researchers found that around 2,500 power plants are planned, enough to double electricity production by 2030.  But the authors say that less than 10% of the new power generated will come from wind or solar. The authors say that Africa now risks being locked into high carbon energy for decades.  They argue that a rapid, decarbonisation shock is needed to cancel many of the plants currently planned.  Prince Charles asks firms to join 'Earth charter'Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on record Until now, there has been a widely shared view that African countries would ""leapfrog"" directly to renewable energy sources, and away from old world coal, oil and gas.  This has already happened with communications, where countries have invested in cellular technology and over 90% of people across the continent have access to a mobile service. But the new research indicates that this same sort of leap isn't likely to happen with green electricity over the next decade.  By 2030, the study suggests that coal, oil and gas will continue to dominate the generation of electricity across 54 African countries, with just 9.6% coming from renewable sources, excluding hydro power. ""We based our analysis on understanding the chances of the power plants that are currently being planned, being commissioned by the end of this decade,"" lead author Galina Alova from the University of Oxford told BBC News.  ""In the next few years, we see that renewable energy power plants have, for example, lower success chances than gas and oil.""  ""We find that the success chances have been improving especially for solar, but for others like wind particularly, they're still quite modest."" The researchers used machine learning to analyse the factors behind the success or failure of previous power plants. They then applied this knowledge to the 2,500 projects in the pipeline.  One key element they concluded, is the size of the project. Bigger plants fail more often.   The importance of size is seen in the experience of solar power in South Africa,  ""They have auctioned off a lot of quite small plants at the beginning to really get a lot of investors interested,"" said co-author Philipp Trotter, also from Oxford University.  ""As the first couple of rounds were successful, they ramped up the projects, they became a little bit larger. And you really see this transition starting to happen in one of the most fossil fuel dominated countries on the continent."" South Africa is predicted to add almost 40% of Africa's total predicted new solar capacity by 2030.  The same sort of success is not expected in other countries.  In the Central African Republic and Gabon, the failure rate for all planned power plants was over 80%.  Other key factors that influence the success or failure of electricity generation include the type of fuel used. The researchers predict hydro-electric installations will have the lowest chance of success of any fuel, at 61%.  Despite the poor outlook for renewables, the authors say that there are a number of factors that could shift the odds in favour of green energy over the next decade.  ""Internationally, we're still using development finance for fossil fuelled plants,"" said Philipp Trotter.  ""The US is heavily investing in natural gas plants in Africa. If you redirect a majority of these funds to renewables, that is when you can really kick start them. That's especially important for a technology like wind, which hasn't really taken off yet in Africa.  The authors also argue for more African governments to take ownership of renewable projects.  The most crucial thing though, according to Galina Alova, is to act and act now.  ""There's still time to turn it around. But the deeper you go into the planning and construction stages of projects, the harder it would be to turn it around at large scale. So it's really important to act really fast.""

"Nasa's Curiosity rover: 3,000 days on Mars"," The US space agency (Nasa) is about to put its latest rover, Perseverance, on Mars. But we shouldn't forget that the existing robot, Curiosity, is still there and working well following its landing in equatorial Gale Crater back in 2012. Curiosity celebrates 3,000 Martian days, or Sols, on the surface of the Red Planet on Tuesday. The Mission Science Team has collected together a series of pictures that record some of the rover's major achievements. When we got these images down in June 2018 it was a big relief for the team, even though it was a rather dusty time on Mars. That's because it marked the restart of drilling operations by the rover. ""Duluth"" was the first rock sample successfully drilled (see centre of the image for the drill hole) since October 2016. A mechanical issue had taken the drill offline. By June 2018, a new technique had been planned and tested by the JPL engineers, letting us get back to the crucial drilling, without which our work had been held back. Blast-off for Nasa mission to detect life on MarsChina's Mars rover rockets away from EarthUAE launches historic first mission to Mars Twice every Martian year, near the seasonal equinoxes, the paths of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos cross in front of the Sun as seen by Curiosity. This animation shows the 22km diameter Phobos in transit across the sun on Sol 2359. The transit lasted about 35 seconds. The precise timing of transits measured in observations like this helps scientists understand the tidal interactions between Phobos and Mars. The tiny amount of water vapour in the thin atmosphere of Mars can form clouds, especially in the cooler times of year and around high peaks. Curiosity has observed thin clouds overhead many times in its mission. But on Sol 2410, it was able to observe a special kind of cloud that forms at very high altitudes, in this case about 31km above the surface. These clouds are called ""noctilucent"" because they remain illuminated by the sun even after sunset has occurred at the surface. This stunning panorama is the highest-resolution panorama (1.8 billion pixels) yet of the Martian surface and was taken in late 2019 at Glen Torridon. Because preparing such panoramas takes numerous photographs (there are over 1,000 telephoto images in this mosaic) over many days' work, we don't often have a chance to produce them. We had been studying the clay-rich rocks in Glen Torridon and named it after an important area of ancient sediments in Scotland. On Sol 2784 Curiosity paused to capture a family portrait of Earth and its planetary neighbours. The foreground shows a cliff on Mars; while in the sky, one can see both Venus and Earth appearing like stars in the dusty evening sky. In the summer of 2020, Curiosity's science team began driving the rover toward a new and higher region on Mount Sharp where it will explore rocks rich in sulphate minerals. Because Mount Sharp was formed as layers of sediment were deposited by water and wind, the rocks get younger with height.  The sulphate minerals in this region may have formed because Mars went from wetter conditionsâgood for forming clay mineralsâto drier conditions that could leave salts such as sulphates behind. On Sol 2696, Curiosity completed its steepest drive of the mission as it ascended the sandy slope below the Greenheugh pediment, a broad flat surface capped by a sandstone layer.  The rover took these images on Sol 2729 as it looked across the layered sandstones and back over the Glen Torridon region below. We all know Mars as the Red Planet, we see that in the night sky.  However, as our drill tailings gallery shows, once we drill just a small depth in to the interior, Mars can be very different. We have drilled successfully 29 times now and the sediments show a range of hues from ochre-red to blue-grey reflecting the minerals and fluids that passed through the ancient rocks. Drilling allows us to get through the top most, oxidized surface that has been most exposed to cosmic radiation. Curiosity in isolation at Glasgow. Here we snapped the Curiosity rover with the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Each of the pixels is about 25cm, so we can pick out the rover quite nicely in the centre of the field of view. We had just completed a drill at a site we named Glasgow. Because of the lockdown an even greater proportion of rover operations was being done by staff working from home. But after eight Earth years, more than three Martian years and 29 drill holes - all is still working pretty well. The HiRISE image covers a region called Greenheugh pediment, part of the lower slopes of Mount Sharp which we will be slowly driving up over the next three years of an extended mission. It's in this next part of the mission that we expect to find a different sort of ancient environment to the earlier parts of the mission, with lots of sulphate minerals. With no rain in the current climate, dust accumulates on the surface of Mars. Winds energized by the Sun's heating of the ground can form large and well-formed whirlwinds known as vortices. They mostly are invisible, but when a strong vortex drifts over a dusty surface, dust is lifted into it and reveals its shape. This animation was shot over four minutes on Sol 2847 and captured a ""dust devil"" vortex at a distance of one-half to one km from the rover. The dust devil is about 5m wide and at least 50m tall. Curiosity took its latest ""selfie"" on Sol 2922 to celebrate the successful drilling of three holes on the rock slab in front of it. The first two holes were named after Mary Anning, the 19th Century palaeontologist whose findings in the seaside cliffs of southwest England contributed to the understanding of prehistoric marine life on Earth. Material from these holes was used for two ""wet chemistry"" experiments, in which it was mixed with liquid chemicals to extract organic molecules that may be preserved in the rock. Rocks at this site formed from sediment carried in ancient streams and lakes. The wet environment and the presence of organic molecules in several rocks studied by Curiosity suggest that ancient Mars was habitable, capable of supporting life, if it ever took hold. The third hole was drilled to study dark nodules visible in the corner of the slab. A Martian day, or Sol, lasts 24 hours and 39 minutes. The 3,000th Sol of the Curiosity mission is marked on 12 January.

UK allows emergency use of bee-harming pesticide," A pesticide believed to harm bees has been authorised for emergency use in England, despite an earlier ban. In 2018, an almost total ban was put in by the EU and UK because of the serious damage it could cause to bees. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says its use will be limited to this year only.  A spokeswoman told Newsbeat the measures ""will be tightly controlled to minimise any potential risk to pollinators"". Emergency use of a product containing the chemical thiamethoxam has been allowed because a virus is threatening sugar beet seeds. Scientific studies have long linked the use of these chemicals to the decline of honeybees, wild bees and other animals which pollinate plants. At the time of the ban, Michael Gove, then environment secretary, said the UK was in favour as it couldn't ""afford to put our pollinator populations at risk"". But according to Defra, the amount of sugar beet grown in 2020 was reduced due to the yellow virus - and similar conditions in 2021 would cause the same problems, unless it took action. Along with the UK, 10 EU countries including Belgium, Denmark and Spain - countries with significant sugar production - have granted emergency authorisations. Milan Wiercx van Rhijn, from the charity Bees for Development feels ""disappointed"" by the government's decision. The 32-year-old says the insects play a vital role in the food chain - with around a third of the food we eat relying on pollination mainly by bees.  ""If we kill the insects which are the starting blocks in the chain, we'll kill the animals higher up,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""It's hard to grasp how much of an impact it'll have on us."" Milan agrees it's important to protect sugar beet - but says the government has to find another way. ""If we keep thinking about these short-term solutions and rolling back, we'll never get to the point where we don't use these products."" ""I thought we saw an end to these chemicals. But it's creeping back now."" He suggests a greater focus on having ""strong, resilient bio-abundance"" - which is letting things grow properly and ""not cutting them down"". ""Keep your flowers growing in the spring, as that will have food for pollinators. In every way, we should consider our effect in killing everything by using pesticides.""   The Defra spokeswoman says this emergency authorisation has only happened because it's an ""exceptional circumstance where diseases or pests cannot be controlled by any other reasonable means"". They added ""protectingâ¯pollinators is a priority for this government"". Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

COP26: Alok Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role," Alok Sharma is to leave his position as business secretary to focus full-time on his role as president of the UN COP26 climate conference in November. The Glasgow event is expected to be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted. Mr Sharma, who will remain in the cabinet, said he was ""delighted to have been asked by the PM to dedicate all my energies"" to the position. Kwasi Kwarteng replaces him as business secretary while Anne-Marie Trevelyan becomes the new energy minister. The government says a successful summit will be critical if the UK wants to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. The event had originally been scheduled for November 2020 but was delayed by a year due to Covid-19. Sharma 'overloaded' to juggle UN summit role2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on recordWhy 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The BBC's political correspondent Jessica Parker said the decision to move Alok Sharma wasn't a surprise and would be seen as a recognition of the need to free him up to do more of the crucial diplomatic leg-work required. Some MPs had previously warned that Mr Sharma lacked the ""bandwidth"" to head the conference alongside his cabinet job, especially given the strains on business due to the pandemic.  In his new role, which is based in the Cabinet Office, Mr Sharma's will remain a member of Boris Johnson's top team but be focused solely on coordinating global action to tackle climate change Boris Johnson chose Mr Sharma to head the event after ex-minister Claire O'Neill was ousted from the position in the summer of 2019.  She later condemned what she called broken promises and backsliding on climate commitments. Former Conservative PM David Cameron turned down the chance to head the conference and ex-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague was also involved in discussions.  Mr Sharma's move will be welcomed by climate campaigners, who worried he was over-stretched running a frantically busy department while also orchestrating the most important climate meeting on Earth. Many of these summits - known as COPs - yielded little because the leadership was poor.  The French produced a triumphant agreement in the 2015 Paris COP after mustering the mighty force of French diplomacy. Mr Sharma is reported to accept that he now needs to concentrate full time on the challenge. He will need subtle diplomatic skills, a mastery of detail and the stamina of an ox as he attempts to corral world leaders into agreement on curbing emissions faster. He'll also need 100% support from the PM. The greatest obstacle to action - Donald Trump - will soon disappear from the scene, and with China making bold promises, the COP has potential.  But politicians have been so slow to act that some key tipping points in the climate might already have been breached. Reflecting on his new role, Mr Sharma said: ""The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations. ""Through the UK's Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal."" Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: ""Allowing Alok Sharma to focus full-time on his COP26 role is a sensible decision, not least as it signals the government's commitment to ensuring that the summit is a success. ""With the election of Joe Biden as the next US President and China's recent carbon neutrality pledge, the diplomatic opportunities have opened up for more ambitious action on climate change. Mr Sharma's job will be to seize them.""  And ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who led the UK delegation at the Paris climate change conference, said the move showed the government ""recognises the importance and opportunity for a global agreement this year"". Responding to his new appointment, Mr Kwarteng said he was ""thrilled"" and pledged to help businesses through this period of ""extremely challenging circumstances"".  The Spelthorne MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, has been energy minister since July 2019.  Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Kwarteng had ""a massive task"" in providing business with ""a plan to help them through this year, not the inadequate sticking plaster measures we have seen"".  He welcomed the decision to make Mr Sharma's COP role full time. ""It's absolutely crucial that the full political, diplomatic and strategic resources of government are now directed to the most ambitious outcome at Glasgow, which is a 1.5 degree deal.""",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 18:43:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55588750
Climate change: 2020 in a dead heat for world's warmest year," New data from EU satellites shows that 2020 is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the world's warmest year.  The Copernicus Climate Change Service says that last year was around 1.25C above the long-term average.  The scientists say that unprecedented levels of heat in the Arctic and Siberia were key factors in driving up the overall temperature.  The past 12 months also saw a new record for Europe, around 0.4C warmer than 2019. Alaskan wilderness opens up for oil exploration Five reasons to feel hopeful about climate changeGreen body gives verdict on UK's climate policies Last December, the World Meteorological Organization predicted that 2020 would be one of the three warmest years on record.  This new, more complete report from Copernicus says that last year is right at the top of the list.  The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.  Temperature data from the system shows that 2020 was 1.25C warmer than the average from 1850-1900, a time often described as the ""pre-industrial"" period. One key factor driving up the temperatures was the heating experienced in the Arctic and Siberia.  In some locations there, temperatures for the year as a whole were 6C above the long-term average. This exceptional warming led to a very active wildfire season. Fires in the Arctic Circle released a record amount of CO2, according to the study, up over a third from 2019.  The Copernicus service concludes that while 2020 was very marginally cooler than 2016, the two years are statistically on a par as the differences between the figures for the two years are smaller than the typical differences found in other temperature databases for the same period. More data on 2020's temperature will be released in the next week or so from other agencies, including Nasa and the UK Met Office.  The scientists say that the closeness between the years is all the more remarkable considering the impacts of the El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a weather cycle.  Twenty-sixteen was made warmer by a strong El NiÃ±o event while 2020 was made slightly cooler by an emerging La NiÃ±a in the second half of the year. Europe also saw a new record level of warming for the year, 0.4C warmer than 2019. A major heat wave in July and August was an important factor driving up the mercury across the continent.  Globally, the 10-year period from 2011-2020 is the warmest decade, with the last six years being the six hottest on record.  ""Twenty-twenty stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic,"" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. ""It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future."" While a strong La NiÃ±a may cool temperatures a little in 2021, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are likely to remain high, contributing to ongoing warming.  New data from the UK's Met Office suggests that average concentrations of CO2 will reach levels that are 50% higher than they were before the industrial revolution.  Researchers predict that annual average CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii will be around 2.29 parts per million (ppm) higher in 2021 than in 2020.  Despite the global slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientists say this rise is being driven by emissions from the use of fossil fuels and from deforestation. While weather patterns linked to the La NiÃ±a event may boost growth in tropical forests and increase the amount of the gas that's absorbed, it won't be enough to slow the overall rise.  The Met Office says that CO2 will exceed 417ppm in the atmosphere for several weeks from April to June.  This is 50% higher than the level of 278ppm that pertained in the late 18th Century as widespread industrial activity was just beginning.  ""The human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,"" said Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office. ""It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase."" ""Reversing this trend and slowing the atmospheric CO2 rise will need global emissions to reduce, and bringing them to a halt will need global emissions to be brought down to net zero. This needs to happen within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C.""

Greener planes of the future... or just pretty plans?," At an undisclosed location Airbus has spent months testing a radical looking plane. At 10ft (3m) wide, it is only small, but it could be the start of something very big in the aerospace industry. It looks like a flying wedge - known in the trade as a blended-wing design. Airbus calls the remote-controlled aircraft Maveric and is keen to emphasise that, at the moment, it is only exploring how the configuration works. But it says the design has ""great potential"". One day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet. In traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky. Under a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload. Maveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. ""There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,"" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant. ""We believe that we have to go into a reallyâ¦ breakthrough technology,"" she says. An equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Researchers there are working on a design known as the ""Flying-V"". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350. Like Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves. The designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be ""plugged"" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once. ""We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,"" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology. The design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany. The flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success. Researchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as ""Dutch roll"". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as ""a somewhat rough landing"" that damaged the front landing gear. Data from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator. Airlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V. The attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact. But with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as ""showstoppers"".

Among them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency. There's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the ""wing"" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal. Building a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region. ""That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,"" says Mr Wright. Airbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer. Its rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Aircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier. Boeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design. But current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at the 2019 Paris Airshow - are based on proving that concept. For longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power. One major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane. But the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities. Those priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion. Airbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power. In September, Airbus unveiled three concept hydrogen-powered designs. Hydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing. But there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide. In order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution. ""Over the next decade, in order for society at large to meet the Paris Agreement, to meet our climate targets, we need to shift to renewable hydrogen,"" he explains.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:06:33 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51751984
Consultation launched over gene edited food in England," The UK government has launched a consultation on using gene editing to modify livestock and food crops in England. Gene editing alters the DNA of organisms and, until now, its use had been tightly restricted under EU law.  Environment Secretary George Eustice said the approach could be used to develop crops that are more resistant to disease and extreme weather. He said it could also lead to the production of healthier food, but some are opposed to the technology. Critics say it creates entirely new organisms, and maintain that stringent regulation is vital. Gene editing is GM, says European CourtTwo women share chemistry Nobel in historic winFirst gene-editing in human body attemptChina jails 'gene-edited babies' scientist Gene editing involves making precise changes to the DNA of one particular species and many scientists regard it as distinct from genetic modification (GM), where DNA from one type of organism is introduced to another.  However, in 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that it did, in fact, count as genetic engineering. And, in the EU, both technologies are currently under strict regulation. Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, Mr Eustice said the UK no longer had to ""slavishly follow"" European law, which was ""notoriously restrictive and politicised"".  The Environment Secretary said the technology mimicked the natural breeding process, speeding up what farmers have done for centuries by picking the strongest and healthiest animals or plants to breed from.  Mr Eustice said that gene editing raised far fewer ethical or biological concerns than other forms of genetic engineering. He said the organisms created by gene editing could have been created naturally and so ""respected the laws of nature"". Many scientists have welcomed the public consultation. Denis Murphy, professor of biotechnology at the University of South Wales said it would be broadly supported by UK farmers and crop scientists.  He explained: ""Genome editing is already used in medicine and has immense potential for tackling major agricultural challenges related to food security, climate change, and sustainability."" Prof Katherine Denby, from the University of York, described genome editing as a ""powerful tool"" that could help tackle a range of challenges in the UK and food system.  Along with helping to increase resistance to pests and disease in crops and animals, it could reduce the use of antibiotics and chemical pesticides, enhance animal welfare, make food more healthy, and reduce waste, for example by lengthening the shelf life of fruit and vegetables.  She said: ""Its impact depends on how it is used, what specific changes are made in what organism. But its precision and speed have the ability to transform the development of new crop and animal breeds, and help drive more sustainable food production."" The creators of the first gene editing tool, known as Crispr-Cas9 ""genetic scissors"", Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, were awarded a Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2020. The development was hailed as ""revolutionary"". Prof Ian Crute, former Chief Scientist of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) and director of Rothamsted Research, said: ""Genetic improvement of crops and livestock is a vitally important activity to counter threats posed to productive agriculture by climate change and the emergence of new pests and diseases.  ""Adoption of gene editing, alongside established practices deployed by crop and livestock breeders, has the potential to add speed and precision to this vital and continuous endeavour."" The Soil Association (SA) said it welcomed technological innovation, but that Brexit shouldn't be used ""to pursue a deregulatory agenda"".  Gareth Morgan, head of farming and land use policy at the SA, said: ""Gene editing is a sticking plaster - diverting vital investment and attention from farmer-driven action and research which could be yielding results, right now.""  He added: ""Consumers and farmers who do not want to eat or grow genetically modified crops or animals need to be offered adequate protection from this. The focus needs to be on how to restore exhausted soils, improve diversity in cropping, integrate livestock into rotations and reduce dependence on synthetic nitrogen and pesticides."" Some scientists warned that any change in approach towards genetic engineering should proceed with great caution.  Dr Adrian Ely, reader in technology and sustainability at the University of Sussex, said that allowing gene editing in the UK ""would require us to open up indiscriminately to GE (gene edited) food imports from around the world"".  He said: ""Claims about gene editing's benefits for the UK's nature and the environment are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties. We need to take the time to consider these carefully, rather than accepting them without interrogation."" The animal welfare charity the RSPCA is concerned at the move, with chief executive Chris Sherwood saying: ""Claims that gene editing is the same as natural selection or plant grafting are disingenuous and potentially misleading."" He said: ""Gene editing is an unproven technology which does not take into account animal welfare, ethical or public concerns.  It involves procedures that cause pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm and is an inefficient process, using large numbers of animals to produce a single individual with the desired result."" Groups campaigning against the deregulation of gene editing were alarmed at the announcement. Dr Helen Wallace, the director of GeneWatch UK, said: ""Removing some new GM technologies from regulation would mean they are not traced or labelled or assessed if they are safe.  ""There would be massive implications at borders since many markets won't accept unlabelled GM food, so English crops and foods might simply be refused."" The UK government has said it will adhere to the strongest health and safety standards. The consultation will run for 10 weeks, until March 17.

Alaska: Trump opens wilderness up for oil drilling," The Trump administration is pushing ahead with the first sale of oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves.  Now, after decades of dispute, the rights to drill for oil on about 5% of the refuge will go ahead.  Opponents have criticised the rushed nature of the sale, coming just days before President Trump's term ends. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate changeGreen body gives verdict on UK's climate policies2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmest Covering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km) the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. It is a critically important location for many species, including polar bears.  In the winter months, pregnant bears build dens in which to give birth. As temperatures have risen and sea ice has become thinner, these bears have started building their dens on land.  The coastal plain of the ANWR now has the highest concentration of these dens in the state.  The refuge is also home to Porcupine caribou, one of the largest herds in the world, numbering around 200,000 animals.  In the spring, the herd moves to the coastal plain region of the ANWR as it is their preferred calving ground.  The same coastal plain is now the subject of the first ever oil lease sale in the refuge.  The push for exploration in the park has been a decades long battle between oil companies supported by the state government and environmental and indigenous opponents.  Many of Alaska's political representatives believe that drilling in the refuge could lead to another major oil find, like the one in Prudhoe Bay, just west of the ANWR. Prudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and supporters believe the ANWR shares the same geology, and potential reserves of crude oil.  Oil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund. In 2017, the Trump administration's tax cutting bill contained a provision to open up the ANWR coastal plain for drilling. It was seen as a way of offsetting the costs of the tax cuts. The US Bureau of Land Management is now selling the drilling rights to 22 tracts of land covering about one million acres. These oil and gas leases last for 10 years.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter A last-minute attempt to stop the sale in the courts failed but opponents say it will not be the end of their efforts to protect the refuge from drilling.  ""The Trump administration is barrelling forward without doing the careful, legally required analyses of the impacts such activity will have on the environment or the Gwich'in people who have relied on this land for millennia,"" said Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, who had sought an injunction against the sale.  ""That's why we've taken them to court. We can't let Trump turn this amazing landscape into an oil field."" Reports indicate that interest in the lease sales has been low.  While estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill for oil. Several large US banks have said they will not fund oil and gas exploration in the area. There is also the matter of a change of leadership in the White House. The Biden team have nominated Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. She is on record as being strongly opposed to drilling in the ANWR. With climate change set to be a central focus for the Biden administration, it's likely that efforts to extract new fossil fuels in Alaska will be subject to review and delay.  This could ultimately limit the interest and opportunity for oil exploration in the refuge.  Follow Matt on Twitter.

Whitehaven coal mine: Government refuses to call in plans," Plans for the UK's first deep coal mine in 30 years can progress after the government decided not to intervene. Cumbria County Council approved the Â£165m West Cumbria Mining plan in Whitehaven in October. The government could have called in the plans for an inquiry, but has chosen not to do so, the council said. Citing environmental concerns, Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron said the decision was a ""complete disaster for our children's future"". The former Liberal Democrats leader, who had requested the government call in the scheme, also described it as an ""almighty backwards step in the fight against climate change"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The mine, which will remove coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea for the production of steel in the UK and Europe, has been approved twice since 2017. However, the council needs to consider it again after the mining firm said further analysis of the coal meant it could ""improve"" the plant's design. West Cumbria Mining claims it would create 500 jobs and pay into a community fund for 10 years. A council spokesman said: ""We have been informed that the [government] has decided not to call in the decision on the planning application for West Cumbria Mine. ""The council will now work with the developer to formalise the legal planning obligations, referred to as a section 106 agreement.  ""The section 106 agreement will need to be finalised before the council can formally give the development permission."" People concerned about the climate are dismayed at the decision not to block the mine.  The prime minister has made several recent speeches expressing his determination to shift away from fossil fuels to protect the planet, and this decision points in the opposite direction.   The government doubtless has in mind the number of jobs that may be created by the mine in an area of high unemployment and it has to find policies that will tackle problems across society, not just the environment.  But environmentalists say jobs should be generated by investing in clean energy and building a greener future, not by industries that harm the atmosphere. They warn that Secretary of State Robert Jenrick's decision not to call the plans in hugely undermines the UK government's claims of global leadership on the climate challenge. Friends of the Earth spokesman, Tony Bosworth, said the refusal to call in the decision was ""climate-wrecking"". He added: ""Allowing coal to be extracted from this proposed mine for over a quarter of a century completely undermines the government's credibility on the climate crisis. ""Global leadership on the climate emergency means leaving coal in the ground, where it belongs."" More than 2,300 people objected to the plan along with campaigners including Friends of the Earth, Keep Cumbrian Coal in the Hole (KCCH) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

Islanders help rescue orca stranded on Orkney beach," A young orca has been rescued after becoming stranded on a beach in Orkney. The 3.4m (11ft) long animal, thought to be a male, was spotted at Bay of Newark on Sanday on Monday. Volunteers from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) charity and local residents spent more than an hour helping the orca. They managed to get it into a position where it could breathe properly and eventually swim out into open water once the tide had come in. BMLR said strandings of orca were ""incredibly rare"" and it believed the Sanday incident was the first successful rescue of an orca by its volunteers. The charity said it would monitor the island's beaches for the next few days to make sure the whale did not strand again. A special stretcher for rescuing dolphins was used to keep the orca upright and not lying on its side. The charity said: ""After about an hour and with help from local residents to stabilise the animal, it suddenly took matters into its own fins and made a move to swim off.  ""Unable to hold the animal any longer, the stretcher was lowered and the orca swam forward straight out towards the open sea."" Orca can be seen around Scotland's north and west coasts. Animals from a pod known as the 27s were seen hunting seals off Sunday at Christmas, but the orca rescued on Monday is not from any of the pods seen around Orkney and Shetland. Orkney Marine Mammal Research Initiative has been liaising with experts, including in Norway, to try and identify the young animal.

Lyme Regis Mary Anning statue designs released," Early designs for a statue of Dorset palaeontologist Mary Anning have been released as campaigners make a final push to reach their funding target. The Mary Anning Rocks campaign has been working to create a permanent memorial in Anning's hometown of Lyme Regis. Her discoveries in the early 19th Century helped shape scientific understanding of prehistoric life, but her work was never properly recognised. The design sketch by sculptor Denise Dutton shows Anning with her dog, Tray. The campaign for the statue, led by 13-year-old Evie Swire, is supported by Prof Alice Roberts who appeared in a video to launch a crowdfunding bid to raise Â£100,000. The campaigners, who have raised more than half of their target, have said they still need Â£20,000 before they can commission the work. Ms Dutton, who created the Land Girls monument at the National Arboretum, has been chosen to create the sculpture which will stand on the town's seafront, close to Anning's birthplace. Anning, whose life inspired feature film Ammonite, was never fully credited for her discoveries due to her gender and social status. She was born in 1799 to a poor, working-class family, but made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including a 5.2m (17ft) skeleton, now known to be an ichthyosaur, when she was just 12 years old. Twelve years later, she found the first complete skeleton of a plesiosaur, a marine reptile so bizarre that scientists initially thought it was a fake. Dorchester schoolgirl Evie launched her campaign, with the help of her mother Anya Pearson, two years ago after learning about Anning during a fossil-hunting trip. ""She's done all these amazing things and sadly has been lost in history,"" Evie said.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 12:10:28 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-55546699
Mexican fisherman 'dies after attack on Sea Shepherd conservationists'," A Mexican fisherman has died after his boat collided with a larger vessel used by US conservationist group Sea Shepherd, reports say. Sea Shepherd said the clash happened after fishing boats attacked one of its vessels in the Gulf of California, where it is working to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise. It said its vessel was trying to leave when one of the boats smashed into it. The man's family allege that his boat was intentionally rammed.  Health official Alonso Perez told AFP news agency on Monday that one fisherman died after sustaining serious injuries, while a second remained in a stable condition. Sea Shepherd said its Farley Mowat vessel was removing an illegal net from a protected area on 31 December when a group of people on small fishing boats launched a ""violent attack"", including throwing Molotov cocktails.  ""Following routine anti-piracy procedures, the Farley Mowat undertook defensive manoeuvring to avoid the attacks. As the vessel attempted to leave the scene, one of the [boats] aggressively swerved in front of the Farley Mowat, crashing directly into the hull"" and splitting in two, it said.  The group said it provided emergency first aid to the two men who had been on board the fishing boat. Conservationists working for Sea Shepherd have been attacked several times while patrolling the vaquita refuge. The group works with Mexican authorities to remove illegal gillnets used to catch totoaba fish, which are highly valued in Chinese traditional medicine. The nets are designed to trap the heads of fish but not their bodies, but are blamed for trapping and killing the endangered porpoises as well.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 03:25:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-55540506
Woolly rhino from Ice Age unearthed in Russian Arctic," The remarkably preserved carcass of an Ice Age-era woolly rhino has been unearthed by locals in eastern Siberia, researchers have said. The rhino was revealed by the melting permafrost in the Abyisky region of Yakutia in north-eastern Russia. With most of its internal organs intact, the rhino is among the best-preserved animals ever found in the region. Experts will deliver the rhino to a lab for further studies next month. They are waiting for ice roads to form so they can take the remains to the city of Yakutsk, where scientists will take samples and carry out radiocarbon analyses. The rhino is believed to have lived in the late Pleistocene era, anywhere between 20,000 and 50,000 years ago. Valery Plotnikov, a researcher who examined the remains, told Russian media the rhino was between three and four years old when it died, probably from drowning. She said much of the rhino's soft tissue was still visible, including part of the intestines and genitals. ""A small nasal horn has also been preserved - this is a rarity, since it decomposes rather quickly,"" Ms Plotnikov, a palaeontologist with the Russian Academy of Sciences, was quoted as saying by Yakutia 24 TV. There were traces of wear on the horn, suggesting the rhino ""was actively using it for food"", she said. The rhino was first discovered in August by a local resident on the bank of the Tirekhtyakh river. This is close to the site where another young woolly rhino was recovered in 2014. That rhino, which researchers named Sasha, was estimated to be 34,000 years old. Recent years have seen major discoveries of the remains of mammoths, woolly rhinos, foal, several puppies and cave-lion cubs in parts of Siberia. In September researchers said they had found the well-preserved carcass of a bear from the Ice Age on the Lyakhovsky Islands in north-eastern Russia. Discoveries of this kind are becoming more frequent as global warming melts the permafrost across vast areas of Russia's extreme north and eastern regions. 18,000-year-old frozen 'dog' stumps scientistsMammoth carcass found in SiberiaFour amazing mummified animals from the Ice Age",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 22:31:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55490037
Why 2021 could be crucial for tackling climate change," Countries only have only a limited time in which to act if the world is to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Here are five reasons why 2021 could be a crucial year in the fight against global warming. Covid-19 was the big issue of 2020, there is no question about that.  But I'm hoping that, by the end of 2021, the vaccines will have kicked in and we'll be talking more about climate than the coronavirus. 2021 will certainly be a crunch year for tackling climate change.  Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told me he thinks it is a ""make or break"" moment for the issue. So, in the spirit of New Year's optimism, here's why I believe 2021 could confound the doomsters and see a breakthrough in global ambition on climate. Have countries kept their climate change promises? Snowy UK winters could become thing of the past How hot could it get where you live? In November 2021, world leaders will be gathering in Glasgow for the successor to the landmark Paris meeting of 2015. Paris was important because it was the first time virtually all the nations of the world came together to agree they all needed to help tackle the issue. The problem was the commitments countries made to cutting carbon emissions back then fell way short of the targets set by the conference. In Paris, the world agreed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change by trying to limit global temperature increases to 2C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The aim was to keep the rise to 1.5C if at all possible. We are way off track. On current plans the world is expected to breach the 1.5C ceiling within 12 years or less and to hit 3C of warming by the end of the century. Under the terms of the Paris deal, countries promised to come back every five years and raise their carbon-cutting ambitions.  That was due to happen in Glasgow in November 2020.  The pandemic put paid to that and the conference was bumped forward to this year.  So, Glasgow 2021 gives us a forum at which those carbon cuts can be ratcheted up. And there has already been progress.  The most important announcement on climate change last year came completely out of the blue. At the UN General Assembly in September, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, announced that China aimed to go carbon neutral by 2060. Environmentalists were stunned. Cutting carbon has always been seen as an expensive chore yet here was the most polluting nation on earth - responsible for some 28% of world emissions - making an unconditional commitment to do just that regardless of whether other countries followed its lead. That was a complete turnaround from past negotiations, when everyone's fear was that they might end up incurring the cost of decarbonising their own economy, while others did nothing but still enjoyed the climate change fruits of their labour. And China is not alone.  The UK was the first major economy in the world to make a legally binding net zero commitment in June 2019.  The European Union followed suit in March 2020.  Since then, Japan and South Korea have joined what the UN estimates is now a total of over 110 countries that have set net zero target for mid-century.  Together, they represent more than 65% of global emissions and more than 70% of the world economy, the UN says.   With the election of Joe Biden in the United States, the biggest economy in the world has now re-joined the carbon cutting chorus. These countries now need to detail how they plan to achieve their lofty new aspirations - that will be a key part of the agenda for Glasgow - but the fact that they are already saying they want to get there is a very significant change. There is a good reason why so many countries are now saying they plan to go net zero:  the collapsing cost of renewables is completely changing the calculus of decarbonisation.  In October 2020, the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation, concluded that the best solar power schemes now offer ""the cheapest source of electricity in history"". Renewables are already often cheaper than fossil fuel power in much of the world when it comes to building new power stations.  And, if the nations of the world ramp up their investments in wind, solar and batteries in the next few years, prices are likely to fall even further to a point where they are so cheap it will begin to make commercial sense to shut down and replace existing coal and gas power stations. That is because the cost of renewables follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets. It's like pushing on an open door - the more you build the cheaper it gets and the cheaper it gets the more you build. Think what this means: investors won't need to be bullied by green activists into doing the right thing, they will just follow the money.  And governments know that by scaling up renewables in their own economies, they help to accelerate the energy transition globally, by making renewables even cheaper and more competitive everywhere. The coronavirus pandemic has shaken our sense of invulnerability and reminded us that it is possible for our world to be upended in ways we cannot control. It has also delivered the most significant economic shock since the Great Depression. In response, governments are stepping forward with stimulus packages designed to reboot their economies. And the good news is it has rarely - if ever - been cheaper for governments to make these kind of investments. Around the world, interest rates are hovering around zero, or even negative. This creates an unprecedented opportunity to - in the now familiar phrase - ""build back better"".  The European Union and Joe Biden's new administration in the US have promised trillions of dollars of green investments to get their economies going and kick-start the process of decarbonisation.  Both are saying they hope other countries will join them - helping drive down the cost of renewables globally. But they are also warning that alongside this carrot, they plan to wield a stick - a tax on imports of countries that emit too much carbon. The idea is this may help induce carbon-cutting laggards - like Brazil, Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia - to come onside too. The bad news is that, according to the UN, developed nations are spending 50% more on sectors linked to fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy. The falling cost of renewable and the growing public pressure for action on climate is also transforming attitudes in business.  There are sound financial reasons for this.  Why invest in new oil wells or coal power stations that will become obsolete before they can repay themselves over their 20-30-year life? Indeed, why carry carbon risk in their portfolios at all? The logic is already playing out in the markets.  This year alone, Tesla's rocketing share price has made it the world's most valuable car company. Meanwhile, the share price of Exxon - once the world's most valuable company of any kind - fell so far that it got booted out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average of major US corporations. At the same time there is growing momentum behind the movement to get businesses to embed climate risk into their financial decision making.  The aim is to make it mandatory for businesses and investors to show that their activities and investments are making the necessary steps to transition to a net zero world. Seventy central banks are already working to make this happen, and building these requirements into the world's financial architecture will be a key focus for the Glasgow conference. It is still all to play for. So, there is good reason for hope but it is far from a done deal. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB) (PDF, 10.4MB)The road to clean energy To stand a reasonable chance of hitting the 1.5C target we need to halve total emissions by the end of 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN-backed body that collates the science needed to inform policy. What that means is making the sort of emissions reductions achieved in 2020 thanks to the massive international lockdowns every year to the end of the decade.  Yet emissions are already edging back to the levels they were in 2019. The truth is lots of countries have expressed lofty ambitions for cutting carbon but few have yet got strategies in place to meet those goals. The challenge for Glasgow will be getting the nations of the world to sign up to policies that will start reducing emissions now.  The UN says it wants to see coal phased out completely, an end to all fossil fuel subsidies and a global coalition to reach net zero by 2050. That remains a very tall order, even if global sentiments on tackling global warming are beginning to change. Follow Justin on Twitter.

Green body gives verdict on Boris Johnson carbon-cutting policies," The prime minister's bold promises to protect the climate are not yet backed by policies and cash, says an end-of-year report by a think tank, Green Alliance. It says there's a ""significant gap"" between Boris Johnson's world-leading plans and what's needed to meet the UK's carbon-cutting targets.  The government admits that low-carbon policies are a work in progress - but insists they will be published in coming months. 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmestCreating animal food from a greenhouse gasHave these seven green targets been met? Green Alliance says current government plans add up to less than a quarter of the emissions cuts needed to achieve its 2030 climate goal. Its report estimates that Â£22.7bn of additional spending will be needed to tackle the climate and nature challenge. This annual sum includes: Â£9bn on accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, and on walking, cycling, bus and rail infrastructureÂ£2.3bn on making buildings efficient and kickstarting the roll-out of electric heat pumpsÂ£400m on establishing a resource efficiency programme for industryÂ£6.6bn on nature restoration and the food and farming sector The authors say: ""During 2020 there have been many signals of intention to act on climate and nature.  ""But policy and spending has fallen short of what's needed to achieve these aims. There's an immediate spending shortfall in meeting the UK's climate and nature goals to the end of this parliament in 2024."" The authors note that the UK has the chance to lead the world on climate policies at the vital global climate conference hosted by Glasgow next year. But they say: ""The UK can only lead if it has its own house in order."" A government spokesperson didn't deny the gaps in policy and funding but insisted that forthcoming strategies would show how carbon emissions would be reduced in every economic sector.  ""Building on the prime minister's ambitious ten point plan, the recently published energy White Paper provides concrete measures to fully decarbonise our electricity system by 2050 and build back better, while ensuring reliable and affordable energy for consumers. ""This is part of a suite of bold plans across key sectors of the economy which the government will be publishing in the run up to COP26 (the Glasgow conference), culminating with a comprehensive net zero strategy."" Net zero means that any emissions not cut by 2050 will be offset by activities such as tree planting to soak up the remaining CO2.  Here are the Green Alliance's assessments: Upside The report congratulates the government on bringing forward the start of the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2030.   Ministers also provided more support for low-carbon travel, pledged funding for rail, buses, walking and cycling and have consulted on a Transport Decarbonisation Plan.  Downside The government also invested Â£14bn in building new roads - and that's known to increase demand for car travel, which is incompatible with carbon targets.  Local councils need more cash to help lure people out of their cars through better walking and cycling provision. And all car makers should be ordered to sell an increasing share of zero emission vehicles each year.  Upside The government has new targets for offshore wind capacity and renewed support for onshore wind and solar.  Downside But will the policies get delivered? The authors say there are major obstacles in the planning system to a speedy expansion of renewables. Upside Carbon emissions from industry are 52% below 1990 levels and now account for just a fifth of UK emissions.  The government has pledged a ""green industrial revolution"" and will fund developments in hydrogen and carbon capture (where emissions from chimneys are caught and pumped into rocks underground). Downside Much depends on innovation funding for technologies which are not yet proven.  The report also maintains that funding should be doubled to Â£630m to help firms become more frugal in the materials and energy they use. A waste prevention plan has been delayed.   Upside Buildings account for 18% of UK carbon emissions. The government introduced the Green Homes Grant to support people to improve insulation and install clean heating such as heat pumps.  It is also consulting on efficiency standards in rental properties, and on a heat and buildings strategy. Downside The Â£1bn allocated to the Green Homes Grant next year is much less than the advisory Climate Change Committee say is needed.  There is still no long term, fully-funded strategy for upgrading housing, while 70% of UK homes do not yet meet the government's carbon reductions target. Upside Brexit has allowed the UK to formulate a strategy which rewards farmers for helping the environment - including offsetting carbon emissions, instead of paying farmers for the amount of land they farm.  Ministers are incentivising tree planting.  Downside Emissions from agriculture account for 7% of UK emissions, and have remained flat since 2008. Details of new policies are awaited, and there will be a gap in environmental protection once oversight of the EU disappears. The Green Alliance policy ""scorecard"" will be one of many reports into the government's low-carbon plans as ministers prepare to host the Glasgow conference and aims to lead by example.

Five ways to reduce your carbon footprint, We need to drastically cut our carbon emissions to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change.  Global leaders have set targets to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this century. That means putting the same amount of greenhouse gases into the air as we take out.Â  BBC Minuteâs Olivia Le Poidevin reports.,BBC News - Science & Environment,"Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:09:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55437567
Why I'm feeling hopeful about the environment in 2021," This year, 2021, a number of things are coming together to help achieve a low-carbon future. In 25 years of reporting the environment patch I've never been so convinced that the world has the potential to change.  It's about politics: recent bolder climate commitments from the UK, the EU, incoming American President Joe Biden and even China. It's about business: for the first time ever renewable energy investment will exceed that in fossil fuels. And it's about timing: a post-Covid recovery year running up to the global COP26 climate summit in November.  But mostly it's about ideas - an eruption of climate change solutions. Applied human intelligence is the vaccine against climate change. I've been exploring 39 inspiring ideas - some already happening, some in development - and meeting the people behind the projects, who each put a big grin on my face.  Here are five of the most intriguing:  BladeBUG is a rectangular robot which crawls over turbine blades. Imagine a suitcase that sprouted six legs with suction cup feet. Having humans on site to look after marine turbines is risky and expensive, making up 40% of their overall lifetime cost.  But drones will be able to carry BladeBUG to the offshore wind farm before it crawls over the tower and blades using sensors to detect damage or anything reducing its efficiency or lifespan. It can even fill and polish small defects itself.  The International Energy Agency says offshore wind could deliver 18 times today's global electricity demand - and innovations like this will make it even more affordable and achievable. The BladeBUG will undergo commercial trials this year and plans to reach the market in 2022. Growing rice has a similar climate impact to flying - about 2-3% of global warming. Paddy fields are like giant marshlands emitting huge quantities of methane.  Rothamsted Research, in Hertfordshire, has developed 'Direct Seeded Rice' (DSR) which doesn't need to be grown in a puddle so uses less water. The plant has also been bred to grow its first roots and shoots more rapidly which is vital for success in a conventional field system.  It's crossed with existing high-yield varieties and initial results are promising. The water in paddy fields does help to suppress weeds and so this system could need more herbicide but the developers believe farm-ready seeds will be ready in a couple of years with most of the world's rice grown this way in a decade.   Every seven seconds the sustainable forests of Europe yield enough wood to build a four-person family home. Carbon is absorbed by the growing trunk, locked up in the house and then trees are replanted. Wooden construction also lessens the enormous carbon impacts of using concrete and steel.  Cross Laminated Timber - like a super-thick plywood - enables the use of wood for large areas of floors and walls.  The French government has ruled that all new public buildings must be made from at least 50% timber and a 'plyscraper' race is under way with the 18-storey Mjosa Tower in Brumunddal, Norway the current winner.  Around the world taller buildings are on the drawing board but in the UK, building regulation changes in response to the Grenfell Tower fire might limit the use of wood in tall buildings.   In deepest Siberia, Nikita Zimov runs Pleistocene Park. Populated by musk-ox, wild horses and bison, it's like Jurassic Park but with a friendlier crowd. He wants to protect the frozen ground from thawing and releasing carbon in rising temperatures, but to achieve that he says something that sounds like heresy: ""Here trees worsen climate change"".  Arctic forest cover only arrived when humans killed most of the grazing animals including the now-extinct mammoth. As forests are a darker colour than snow-covered grassland, less of the sun's energy is reflected resulting in more ground heating.  Grazing animals also trample the snow to a thin layer which allows the chill of the air to penetrate into the ground, rather than allowing a thick fluffy snow layer to insulate it.  Nikita, and many supporters in Western universities, would like to see trees suppressed across a vast area of the tundra by mass introductions of grazing animals and some deliberate felling. For them, this would mean a re-wilding and potential re-cooling of the Arctic. The experimental park is 50 sq-miles (129.5 sq-km) but to have fuller impact he'd like it to be thousands of times bigger.  The International Energy Agency says solar electricity is now being made more cheaply than any other method of production. But solar panels currently only convert around a fifth of the sun's energy that falls on them into electricity. Sunlight is made up of the spectrum you see in a rainbow and silicon, found in nearly all solar panels, is best at converting the red part into electricity.  But UK-based company Oxford PV is combining silicon with a material called perovskite - a semi conductor mineral with a crystal structure of titanium calcium oxide - which turns the blue wavelengths into electrical energy. This chemical sandwich can increase the panels efficiency to 30-40%.  They are going into production this year and expect early applications to be on rooftops where customers want to maximise the wattage from a confined area.

David Attenborough won't return to Instagram," He's quested for dragons and hung with gorillas. But it seems Sir David Attenborough has finally met a creature he can't make friends with - social media. In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Sir David revealed he won't be returning to Instagram, after quitting back in November. ""I've got enough problems with the post!"" he told Greg James on the breakfast show. But as brief forays into the social world go, it was a pretty impressive one. Sir David swiftly broke records when he joined Insta last year. Sir David Attenborough breaks Jennifer Aniston's Instagram record ""I was persuaded â¦ to do a message about conservation,"" he explained to Greg. ""So for a limited period of time I did contribute to Instagram, but I'm off now. And I don't intend to go back."" If any fans do want to contact the broadcasting legend, sliding into his DMs is not an option. He revealed he's keeping his contact preferences old school. ""I get about 70 letters a day!"" And will he reply if people slide into his actual letterbox? ""If you enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope - I'd be delighted!"" It wasn't just Greg James asking the questions. Year Five student Harry was also on hand via video call to quiz Sir David. First question - what's the scariest animal you've ever encountered?  Being charged by an elephant, was the reply. ""They come running at you at the speed of a motor car, ears flapping and trunk up."" ""But of course, people who are experts in these things know perfectly well that elephants make dummy charges. And that was a dummy charge, just saying 'don't get any nearer'. And I didn't!"" As you'd expect there was also some advice on combatting the climate emergency. Harry wanted to know if there was anything he could do and there was some simple guidance. ""One of the best mottos,"" Sir David told him, ""is 'don't waste things'.""  ""Don't waste food, don't waste electricity, don't waste gas. Don't waste paper. All those things make demands on the planet.""  ""And if we all lived more economically, the world would be a much better place."" And Greg was also keen to talk about the breakout stars of Sir David's new series A Perfect Planet - Vampire Finches. He found them ""sweet"". That prompted a rather disbelieving reply from Sir David. ""Sweet? What? Drinking blood?"" ""It's a new habit,"" he explained, ""â¦drinking blood. It's only recently been filmed.""

Atlantic discovery: 12 new species 'hiding in the deep'," Almost five years of studying the deep Atlantic in unprecedented detail has revealed 12 species new to science.  The sea mosses, molluscs and corals had eluded discovery because the sea floor is so unexplored, scientists say.  Researchers warn that the newly discovered animals could already be under threat from climate change.  Carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean is making it more acidic, causing coral skeletons in particular to corrode. The scientists involved stressed it was ""not too late to protect these special species"" and the important habitats they occupied.  New species: ""At least"" 12 new deep-sea species. The team also found approximately 35 new records of species in areas where they were previously unknownClimate change: Ocean warming, acidification, and decreasing food availability will combine to significantly shift and reduce the availability of suitable habitats for deep-sea species by 2100Hydrothermal vents: Scientists discovered a field of these sea-floor hot springs in the Azores. Hydrothermal fields are important areas of relatively high biological productivity that host complex communities in the midst of the vast deep ocean As Prof George Wolff, an ocean chemist from the University of Liverpool who was involved in the project pointed out: ""We can still say we have better maps of the surface of the Moon and Mars than of the sea floor."" ""So whenever you go to the deep ocean, you find something new - not just individual species but entire ecosystems."" Prof Murray Roberts from the University of Edinburgh led the Atlas project, as it is called. He told BBC News that nearly five years of exploration and investigation had revealed some ""special places"" in the ocean and worked out ""how they tick"".   ""We found whole communities formed by sponges or deep ocean corals that form the cities of the deep sea,"" he explained. ""They support life. So really important fish use these places as spawning grounds.  ""If those cities are damaged by destructive human uses, those fish have nowhere to spawn and the function of those whole ecosystems is lost for future generations.  ""It's like understanding that the rainforest is an important place for biodiversity on the land; the same is true of the deep sea - there are important places that need to be protected and, crucially , they are all connected."" The project involved researchers from 13 countries around the Atlantic - combining ocean chemistry and physics, as well as biological discovery, to work out how the ocean environment is changing as the world warms and as humans exploit more of the deep sea for fishing and mineral extraction.  Studying ocean currents and depositions of fossils on the seabed revealed that the major currents in the North Atlantic have slowed dramatically in response to climate change.  ""The implications of that are complicated, but potentially the connections between ecosystems are being reduced,"" Prof Roberts explained, because ocean currents are the highways that link different habitats together in the vastness of the deep ocean. ""The value of all this knowledge is that it enables us to understand what we might risk losing,"" said Prof Claire Armstrong, a natural resource economist from the University of TromsÃ¸. ""The deep ocean can be so out of sight and out of mind that we're not really aware of what we're doing to its environments and the consequences of what we do."" With a growing global population, increasing pollution and emerging areas of commercial activity in the deep sea, including prospecting for medically and industrially useful products, marine scientists say it is vital to fill the gaps in our ocean knowledge.   The ocean is not an endless resource, Prof Armstrong added. ""Conserving and knowing what we might need in the future is really, really difficult.""

The giant Hornsea Three development lies 75 miles away from Flamborough Head, Englandâs biggest sea bird colony on the Yorkshire coast.  The RSPB says kittiwakes will need to fly through the area, dodging turbines, to reach feeding grounds. The developers have promised to compensate for the impact on the birds. They plan to do this by building four bespoke nesting towers to encourage them on land. But the RSPB says it will take a decade to see whether this idea works â and that will be too late because the wind farms will be up and running by then. Black turbine blade 'can cut bird deaths'A really simple guide to climate changeHave these seven green targets been met? Wind farms are not a straightforward subject for the RSPB in its efforts to protect the UK's birds.   The charity supports the growth of renewable energy to combat the effects of climate change, but is fearful of the impact on birds round the coasts as turbines increase to fulfil the prime minister's promise of powering every home by wind energy. Duncan Clark from developers Orsted said: âClimate change remains a very serious threat to our environment and habitats and there is an ever-pressing need to act.  âHornsea Three could provide clean power to over two million UK homes and offset over 128.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.â The RSPB says computer modelling suggests the huge turbines, stretching over 200 metres, will cause the deaths of 73 kittiwakes a year.  Mr Clark said that the firm would offset the projected deaths by building four artificial kittiwake nest towers on land, which should prompt an equal number of the birds to be born. But the RSPB says the compensation measures proposed at Hornsea Three are speculative, and that like other wind developments in the North Sea, they are undermined by a lack of reliable data.  The RSPBâs Andrew Dodd told BBC News: âWe have no idea whether this plan will work or not. We donât know how many birds are being killed in the first place and we certainly donât know how many of them may be encouraged by breeding towers.â He said kittiwakes had been struggling for three decades â partly because climate change is altering fish patterns and partly because of over-fishing of slim fish called sand eels, which are ground into fishmeal for salmon and pigs. Energy Secretary Alok Sharma acknowledged in his ruling on the development that wildlife would be harmed by Hornsea Three, but he granted consent on the balance of benefits.   His ruling said: âThe adverse impactsâ¦ do not outweigh the significant benefits of the development in respect of contribution it would make to meeting the identified need for renewable electricity generation.â  Kittiwakes appear to try to slalom their way through the wind farms that are springing up across the North Sea.  Other birds such as guillemots and razor bills seem to fly round the thickets of turbines, a journey which uses energy that could otherwise be used for breeding. The RSPB and wind farm association Renewable UK both blame the government for failing to mitigate the conflict between wildlife and clean energy. Mr Dodd said: âThe government has to lead on this. We clearly need loads more offshore wind, and the RSPB supports that. But the North Sea is filling up with turbines and we have to avoid development in the most sensitive areas. We need much better knowledge. âThis issue is cumulative â maybe one wind farm wouldnât make a great deal of difference, but the scale of the plans is massive.â The wind farm industry group Renewable UK anticipates that offshore wind turbine operators will face increasing scrutiny in the coming decade â both in terms of their impact on wildlife and the structures needed on sensitive coastlines to bring the power onshore. The group has urged the government to restore funding to the heavily-cut Natural England, so it can adequately supervise developments. Renewable UKâs Melanie Onn told BBC News: âWe urgently need to build new offshore wind farms to tackle climate change which poses the biggest threat to our way of life. âAdvisory bodies like Natural England need more funding from the government so that they can take decisions in a more timely manner.â Some turbines off the coast of Scotland are now being fitted with cameras on the tower and blades to monitor bird strikes, although this may be very challenging in rough weather. In the US, a study suggested that painting one of the three blades black seemed to help birds avoid contact â but the RSPB says that study was on an onshore turbine, and needs verification. Another scheme has seen wind farms turned off when the approach of rare condors is detected through radio transmitters they carry. This only works for threatened condor but the US equivalent of the RSPB, the Audubon Society, has warned that if climate change continues apace, hundreds of North American bird species' ranges will shrink by at least half by 2100. ""Climate change is the biggest impact on birds,"" said Garry George from Audubon.  What's more, renewable energy campaigners point out that cats and skyscrapers kill far more birds than wind turbines.

Climate change: Extreme weather causes huge losses in 2020," The world continued to pay a very high price for extreme weather in 2020, according to a report from the charity Christian Aid.  Against a backdrop of climate change, its study lists 10 events that saw thousands of lives lost and major insurance costs. Six of the events took place in Asia, with floods in China and India causing damages of more than $40bn. In the US, record hurricanes and wildfires caused some $60bn in losses. 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmestHave countries kept their climate change promises? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk While the world has been struggling to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic, millions of people have also had to cope with the impacts of extreme weather events.  Christian Aid's list of ten storms, floods and fires all cost at least $1.5bn - with nine of the 10 costing at least $5bn. An unusually rainy monsoon season was associated with some of the most damaging storms in Asia, where some of the biggest losses were. Over a period of months, heavy flooding in India saw more than 2,000 deaths with millions of people displaced from their homes.  The value of the insured losses is estimated at $10bn. China suffered even greater financial damage from flooding, running to around $32bn between June and October this year. The loss of life from these events was much smaller than in India. While these were slow-moving disasters, some events did enormous damage in a short period of time.  Cyclone Amphan struck the Bay of Bengal in May and caused losses estimated at $13bn in just a few days. ""We saw record temperatures in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, straddling between 30C-33C,"" said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune. ""These high temperatures had the characteristics of marine heat waves that might have led to the rapid intensification of the pre-monsoon cyclones Amphan and Nisarga,"" he said in a comment on the Christian Aid study.   ""Amphan was one of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon season."" Africa was also on the receiving end of extreme events, with massive locust swarms ruining crops and vegetation to the tune of $8.5bn. The UN has linked these swarms to climate change, with unusually heavy rains in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa in recent years contributing to the locust outbreaks. Europe also saw significant impacts when Storm Ciara swept through Ireland, the UK and several other countries in February.   It resulted in 14 lives being lost and damages of $2.7bn. Christian Aid stress that these figures for financial costs are likely an underestimate as they are based only on insured losses.  Richer countries have more valuable properties, and on the whole suffer greater financial penalties from extreme events. But financial losses don't convey the full impact of these storms and fires.  While South Sudan's floods weren't among the costliest in dollar terms, they have had a huge impact, killing 138 people and wiping out this year's crops. Researchers say that the influence of climate change on extreme events is strong and likely to continue growing.  ""Just like 2019 before it, 2020 has been full of disastrous extremes,"" said Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, from the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia. ""We have seen all this with a 1C of global average temperature rise, highlighting the sensitive relationship between average conditions and extremes."" ""Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will be felt via the extremes, and not averaged changes.""  ""Unfortunately, we can expect more years to look like 2020 - and worse - as global temperatures creep higher."" While 2021 is likely to bring a similar story of losses from extreme events, there is some sense of optimism that political leaders may be on the brink of taking steps that might help the world avoid the worst excesses of rising temperatures.  ""It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this climate change tide,"" said report author, Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. ""With President-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.""

Wildfire smoke may spread infectious disease," Smoke from wildfires could be a surprising new route for the spread of infections, according to research. Scientist say that microbes and fungi can survive in large numbers in smoky plumes.  The authors believe it's likely that organisms from the soil, known to cause infection, could be transferred in this way.  They argue that greater monitoring of wildfire smoke by health authorities is urgently needed. Heathrow wins court battle to build third runway'Not enough' climate ambition shown by leadersEU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% For decades, it has been widely assumed that nothing much lives in a plume of wildfire smoke. It has also been assumed that if smoke poses a threat to human health, it's because it is full of particulate matter.  These microscopic particles of soot are known to be a severe irritant, causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues.  However, there has been growing concern that wildfire smoke could also carry infectious microbes or fungi.  The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC0 says that firefighters are at risk of coccidioidomycosis, a common infection caused by a fungus that becomes airborne when soils are disturbed.  Scientists are now beginning to uncover the scale of the potential infectious threat posed by smoke from wildfires.  Using new techniques to capture microbes in smoke, researchers say that they found over 900 different types of bacteria and around 100 unique fungi. ""The diversity of microbes we have found so far in the very few studies that have been done is impressive,"" said Dr Leda Kobziar, from the University of Idaho, in Moscow, US, who led the review. ""These taxa (groups of living organisms) were not found in non-smoky air in the same locations prior to the fire, proving that combustion and its associated winds aerosolise microbes into smoke columns.""  The researchers believe that the microbes hitch-hike on particulate matter in the smoke.  Even in high-intensity fires, the scientists found bacteria in abundance 300 metres above a fire. Over 60% of these were viable.  They suspect that the particulate matter on which they are travelling protects the microbes from ultraviolet radiation, which might kill them off.  While the scientists have shown that there are large numbers of bacteria in smoke and that they can survive in the plume, the key question is how much of a threat to health do they pose? ""We have found a number of microbes that are commonly known to cause respiratory ailments - things that can trigger asthma, for example,"" Dr Kobziar said, via email.  ""The likelihood of soil and plant-borne organisms known to cause infection is high, but has yet to be experimentally tested."" Previous studies with hurricanes and storms have shown that these infectious agents can travel extremely long distances, although no one has yet shown a similar journey for bacteria in a smoke plume.  But the ability of smoke to travel around the world suggests that it could be a ""missing link"" in explaining some patterns of infection.  ""When infections are detected in patients, the potential causal agents that are screened are based on what is known to be endemic in a given region,"" said Dr Kobziar. ""However, smoke blurs the lines between regions. It may be that many cases of infection with undetermined causal agents have occurred due to smoke transport of microbes outside of their areas where it is endemic.   ""It may be that smoke is the missing link to explain some of these patterns of infection across space and time.""   She added: ""This could also have ecological ramifications."" The review study has been published in the journal Science.

Climate change: 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmest," UK Met Office scientists are forecasting that 2021 will be a little cooler around the world, but will still be one of the top six warmest years.  The La NiÃ±a weather phenomenon will see temperatures edge down but greenhouse gases will remain the biggest influence. Researchers say the world will likely be around 1C warmer than the pre-industrial era. It will be the seventh year in a row close to or above this mark. Electric cars 'will leave hole in tax revenues'Creating animal food from a greenhouse gasâRadicalâ changes to farming in post-Brexit plan'Not enough' climate ambition shown by leaders According to Met Office projections, the Earth's temperature for 2021 will likely be between 0.91C and 1.15C above what they were in the years from 1850-1900 with a central estimate of 1.03C The 2021 forecast is slightly lower than in recent years, due to the onset of the La NiÃ±a event in the tropical Pacific.  A La NiÃ±a develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards the Philippines.  In their place, colder waters from deep in the ocean come up to the surface. It is expected to reduce sea-surface temperatures by 1-2C and will likely do enough to prevent 2021 from setting a new high mark. ""The global temperature for 2021 is unlikely to be a record year due to the influence of the current La NiÃ±a, but it will be far warmer than other past La NiÃ±a years such as 2011 and 2000 due to global warming,"" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the Met Office. Researchers say the impact of a natural cooling event like La NiÃ±a, while important, is hugely overshadowed by the warming driven by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. There was a strong La NiÃ±a in the year 1999-2000, but global temperatures have gone up by 0.4C in the years since then.  This is in line with the estimate of 0.2C warming per decade, attributed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to human activities.  ""The variability of the La NiÃ±a / El NiÃ±o cycle is the second most important factor in determining the Earth's temperature but it is simply dwarfed by the forcing effect of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,"" said Met Office scientist Dr Nick Dunstone. The Met Office says that its experience in forecasting previous annual temperatures gives it confidence in next year's projections.  A year ago, the agency estimated that 2020 would be 0.99C to 1.23C warmer than pre-industrial levels.  Data from January to October this year indicates that the annual temperature will be 1.17C above the 1850-1900 average. 2016 remains the warmest year on record with 2020 vying for second place with 2019.   According to a provisional assessment from the World Meteorological Organization, the warmest six years in global records dating back to 1850 have now all occurred since 2015.  The Met Office expects that 2021 will edge out 2018 for sixth place.

Climate change: Snowy UK winters could become thing of the past," Snowy winters could become a thing of the past as climate change affects the UK, Met Office analysis suggests. It is one of a series of projections about how UK's climate could change, shared with BBC Panorama. It suggests by the 2040s most of southern England could no longer see sub-zero days. By the 2060s only high ground and northern Scotland are still likely to experience such cold days. The projections are based on global emissions accelerating. It could mean the end of sledging, snowmen and snowball fights, says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist who worked on the climate projections. ""We're saying by the end of the century much of the lying snow will have disappeared entirely except over the highest ground,"" she told Panorama. If the world reduces emissions significantly the changes will be less dramatic, the Met Office says. What will climate change look like near me?The year 2020 set to be in top three warmestCovid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2Can sending fewer emails really save the planet?Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk The average coldest day in the UK over the past three decades was -4.3 Celsius. If emissions continue to accelerate, leading to a global temperature rise of 4C, then the average coldest day in the UK would remain above 0 Celsius across most of the country throughout winter. Even if global emissions are reduced dramatically and world temperatures rise by 2C, the average coldest day in the UK is likely be 0 Celsius.   The Met Office says these temperatures are subject to variation and some years may see days colder than the average. Its projections explore how the UK's climate might change.   ""The overarching picture is warmer, wetter winters; hotter, drier summers,"" Dr Kendon says.  ""But within that, we get this shift towards more extreme events, so more frequent and intense extremes, so heavier rainfall when it occurs."" The Met Office says we are already seeing dramatic changes in the UK climate. ""The rate and nature of the climate change that we're seeing is unprecedented,"" says Dr Mark McCarthy of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. Most of the country has already seen average temperatures rise by 1C since the Industrial Revolution and we should expect more of the same, he warns. That may not sound like much, but even these small changes in our climate can have a huge impact on the weather and on many plants and animals. The Met Office says there could be significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer. It says the biggest increases will be in the already warmer southern parts of the UK. At the same time extreme weather is expected to become more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves are likely to become more common and last longer, with record temperatures being exceeded regularly. Not every summer will be hotter than the last, the Met Office says, but the long-term trend is steadily upwards, particularly if emissions remain unabated. That high-emissions scenario shows peak summer temperatures could rise by between 3.7 C and 6.8 C by the 2070s, compared with the period 1981 to 2000. If the world succeeds in reducing emissions, these temperature rises will be considerably smaller. The level of detail in the models mean it is possible to see how the climate might change in neighbourhoods across the country. Hayes in west London, for example, is likely to see some of the most dramatic temperature rises of all, the new data suggests. The average hottest day in Hayes was 32C around 20 years ago. If emissions continue to accelerate, the new Met Office data suggests the average hottest day could reach a sweltering 40C by around 2070. If global emissions reduce, this temperature rise will not be so severe.

And other key terms explained ""I mean, I think it's really frightening. That's a big change, and we're talking about in the course of our lifetime. It's just a wake-up call really as to what we're talking about here,"" says Dr Kendon. Summers might not just be hotter, they could be drier too, the Met Office predicts. Summer rain could become less frequent, but when it does rain it is likely to be more intense.  The combination of longer dry periods with sudden heavy downpours could increase the risk of flooding because dry ground doesn't absorb water as well as damp ground. Rainfall is expected to increase in many parts of the country in winter too, the Met Office says. The projections suggest western parts of the UK may get even wetter under a high-emissions scenario. Of course, some years will always buck the trend by being wetter or cooler than others - and there will be significant regional variations. This pattern of wetter winters and more intense summer downpours across much of the country risks putting infrastructure under greater strain. Roads, railways, reservoirs, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure is all designed for the sort of rainfall we have had in the past and much of it may need to be upgraded or even rebuilt to cope with the storms and floods to come. Last week, the UK government announced ambitious new targets for tackling climate change. The new goal is to cut the UK's greenhouse gas emission by 68% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. Boris Johnson hopes the new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19.

What is Elon Musk's Starship?," Elon Musk is planning to soon launch the prototype of a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. The founding ethos of Elon Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. This is partly motivated by existential threats such as an asteroid collision big enough to wipe out humanity.  Settling other planets would place some of the eggs in other baskets, sparing human civilisation if one of them were to experience a cataclysm. In 2016, the entrepreneur outlined his rationale at an international conference in Mexico: ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" he said. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" Musk has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon?Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guideStarship prototype makes big impact Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully reusable, meaning the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but are instead recovered from space. They can then be refurbished and flown again, reducing the cost of the whole enterprise. The rocket part of the system is called Super Heavy, while the spacecraft part is called Starship. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.  The 50m (160ft) -long craft, also known as the upper stage, has a huge payload compartment near the front that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Towards the middle of the craft are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to six Raptor engines at the rear of the vehicle. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox.  The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. SpaceX has spent more than a decade developing the highly efficient Raptor engine. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with 3,400 tonnes (6.8 million lbs) of cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 28 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times), providing some 16 million lbs (72 Meganewtons) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.  When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.  As it descends, Super Heavy will deploy steel structures called ""grid fins"", shaped a bit like potato waffles, from the sides of the booster. These will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. Previously, SpaceX had wanted to ignite Super Heavy's Raptor engines to guide it down to a precision landing on six steel legs. SpaceX does something similar with the first stages of its Falcon 9 rockets, landing them safely on landing pads and drone ships after a launch. But Mr Musk recently tweeted to say that this thinking had changed. SpaceX now plans to catch the falling booster using an arm on the launch tower.  This is the structure that provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch. How exactly this ""catch mechanism"" will work, however, remains to be seen.  Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-fuelled. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good â you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained during a conference keynote speech in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock, or mate, with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. ""The two ships would actually mate at the rear section. They would use the same mating interface that they use to connect to the booster on lift-off,"" Musk said in 2017. ""To transfer propellant it becomes very simple: You use control thrusters to accelerate in the direction that you want to empty."" For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship might also play a role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In 2020, SpaceX was awarded $135m by Nasa to advance the design of Starship so it could be used as a crewed lunar lander.  The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, to be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the forthcoming successor to Hubble. The system could even be used for high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to Earth, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything elseâ¦ we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk said during a Starship update in 2019.  ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe landing. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System - Mars included. In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the Starship upper stage at its Boca Chica facility in Texas. The company started off with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper, which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower. Since flying this vehicle to 150m above ground, SpaceX has been developing increasingly complex Starship prototypes. In December 2020, SpaceX launched a test article named SN8 (Starship number 8) - the first to feature a nosecone and flaps. After reaching an altitude of 12.5km, SN8 belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of Starship's return from space. It was almost a textbook flight, but the vehicle approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. SpaceX has already moved prototype SN9 to the launch pad, and, this time, they're aiming to stick the landing. In October 2020, Elon Musk said SpaceX was aiming to launch Starship on an uncrewed flight to Mars in 2024. Some observers note that Mr Musk's timelines are sometimes optimistic. But he has also developed a reputation for eventually achieving his goals, no matter how ambitious.

Astronaut Scott Kelly: How to survive a year in space," Astronaut Scott Kelly tells the BBC how he managed to live for a year on the International Space Station and why, four years into his retirement from Nasa, he would go back if someone asked. It's 16 July 2015, and all three occupants of the International Space Station are squeezing into the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that acts as their lifeboat in the event of an emergency. The crew members have been told by mission control that a large, defunct satellite is hurtling their way at 14km per second. Controllers know it will come close, but they can't track the object precisely enough to know if it will skim by or score a devastating bullseye. US astronaut Scott Kelly and Russians Gennady Padalka and Mikhail ""Misha"" Kornienko hunker down in the cramped capsule, waiting for the speeding hunk of metal to close in, following the procedures drawn up for such an eventuality by preparing to detach from the station at a moment's notice and return to Earth. Astronaut Capt Scott Kelly's year in spaceISS crew members end year in space It's hardly the first time Captain Kelly, a former military pilot, has been in a life-threatening situation. But the experience caused him to ponder their collective powerlessness; had the satellite hit, there would have been no time to get away.  ""Misha, Gennady and I would have gone from grumbling to one another in our cold Soyuz to being blasted in a million directions as diffused atoms, all in the space of a millisecond,"" he recalls in his memoir Endurance. Crew rotations on the ISS come with many of the mundane features of everyday life on Earth: video calls, cleaning and bad days at work. But every now and then - as on this occasion - astronauts get a stark reminder of the hostile environment beyond the comforting walls of their vessel. Since 2007, Kelly has made three separate visits to the orbiting outpost. But it was on his last flight between 2015 and 2016 that he gained worldwide recognition.  Along with Misha Kornienko, he was tasked with spending a whole year on the space station - twice the length of a regular stay. In doing so, he smashed the previous long duration spaceflight record for an American - set by astronaut Michael LÃ³pez-AlegrÃ­a - by more than 100 days. But Kelly is just as well known for having an identical twin brother - Mark - who was also a Nasa astronaut. Mark, who is older by about six minutes, was elected as a senator for the state of Arizona in the 2020 US election.  Speaking to me by video call from his home in Colorado, Scott Kelly says there was never a moment he felt like coming home early. ""My goal was always to get to the end of the flight with as much energy and enthusiasm as I had at the beginning - and I think I did that. ""I could have stayed up there longer, if there had been a good reason. So I never really doubted my ability to do that."" Despite the fact that astronauts and cosmonauts are screened for their psychological ability to cope, he says: ""I know that other people have had hard times with it. I've seen that myself in person - some folks having a challenge being isolated like that. It's hard, but it's not so hard you can't do it."" He explains: ""I don't know if it's necessarily an introvert/extravert thing, but you definitely have to be comfortable being your own entertainment,"" adding: ""It's not for everybody."" The toughest things, he says, are not being able to go outside and experience nature, as well as the formidable daily schedule of space station tasks. Another challenge, he says, was sharing a relatively small place with the same people for so long - ""even though all those people are great"". It was a challenge successfully navigated, however, as the close quarters confinement helped forge long-standing friendships: ""I was just exchanging emails with (Nasa's) Kjell Lindgren. My wife and I did a video conference the other day with (Italian European Space Agency astronaut) Samantha Cristoforetti. I talk to Misha Kornienko and Gennady Padalka,"" he explains. The US is committed to four more years of funding for the ISS, but uncertainties remain about support for the orbiting lab after that. The space station was born in the 1990s, during an era of political dÃ©tente between the US and Russia. ""The space station programme has been a great example of international co-operation in a peaceful way,"" he tells me, ""My experience with the cosmonauts on the station has always been one of professionalism, of respect, reliance on each other. ""My hope is that, whenever we do decide to put the space station in the Pacific Ocean, there is something there to replace it. For the last 20 years, all humans have not been on Earth at the same time. I would like to see that continue."" Kelly wasn't consumed by work for the whole of his year in orbit; he also managed to find time for much-needed fun and games. In what would become a viral video, he chased British astronaut Tim Peake through part of the space station dressed in a gorilla suit. Peake, it has to be said, does a good job of projecting alarm - if he is indeed acting. The suit - vacuum-packed and sent up on a supply flight - was a birthday present from Mark, and I ask Scott whether it was some sort of in-joke between the brothers. ""My brother said: 'Hey, I'm sending you a gorilla suit.' And I said: 'Why are you sending me a gorilla suit?' He said: 'Why not?'"" Kelly says, with a wry smile. ""That's about as much thought as was put into that."" The siblings were raised in suburban New Jersey by parents who were both cops. Their mother was the first female officer in the township of West Orange where they grew up, and Scott cites the determination she showed as an inspiration in his efforts to become an astronaut. Mark and Scott showed similar, early propensities for risk-taking that led to frequent injuries, including hospitalisations. But there was a point at school where Mark surged ahead in his studies, while Scott was prone to being easily distracted in class.  At college, it was the party scene competing for Scott's attention. He credits a phone conversation with Mark - who told him to lay off the socialising and knuckle down - with turning his academic fortunes around. After training as a Navy pilot, Scott was assigned to a strike squadron called the World Famous Pukin' Dogs. He flew the F-14 Tomcat - the plane featured in Top Gun - during the 1990s, and carried out combat missions during the first Gulf War.  However, Kelly was eager to become part of an even more elite group - those who have flown the space shuttle. Following his selection as a Nasa astronaut in the class of 1996, along with Mark, Scott served as a pilot on one shuttle mission before commanding another in 2007. On the shuttle, it's the commander that actually pilots the vehicle, and it's on the dizzyingly difficult landing that these skills come into their own. ""I only flew it once. It's kind of crazy to consider how much time and effort you put into doing this one piloting task and then you get to do it once, or twice,"" says Kelly. ""You've got one chance to land this. If you don't, it's not like you're adding power and coming around again. You recognise not only your colleagues are watching but a large part of the rest of the world."" The shuttle was a magnificent, if flawed, vehicle. And the world was reminded of the huge risks of space travel when, in 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke up while returning to Earth - killing seven astronauts. Nasa's safety culture was criticised by investigations in the wake of both the Challenger and Columbia disasters. Kelly lost friends on Columbia and, when I interview him, he is preparing to address the virtual SafetyCulture Summit, alongside Charles ""Sully"" Sullenberger - who landed a stricken US Airways flight on the Hudson River - and environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich.  ""The stuff that we do is so extraordinarily risky,"" he tells me. ""Safety has to be everyone's responsibilityâ¦ everyone needs to know that they are empowered to speak up if there's an issue."" When it was originally proposed that an identical twin would be sent into orbit for a year-long stay on the ISS, one group of scientists eyed a unique opportunity to study the effects of extended periods in space on the human body.  By using an Earth-bound Mark as a genetically identical ""control"", scientists would have greater confidence that any changes they were seeing in Scott were caused by the space environment. Both twins were subjected to a battery of tests measuring potential shifts in their physiology, cognitive abilities, immunity and DNA. Among other things, the results revealed genetic changes that suggested Scott's DNA was repairing itself due to damage from cosmic radiation.  Scientists also saw unexpected changes in ""caps"" on the ends of Scott's chromosomes, called telomeres, as well as shifts in his blood chemistry, body mass and gut flora. But the vast majority of these reversed themselves once he was back on Earth. Four years on, he says: ""I don't have any symptoms of anything that I can definitively point to as caused by that amount of time in space, but I do have some structural and physiological changes to my eyes - though it doesn't affect my vision."" Scientists know that some people are affected more by ocular changes in space than others. And there has been work on the genetics underlying these differences. I ask Kelly if, as we learn more about how different people respond to the space environment, these biological markers could play a bigger role in astronaut selection - perhaps even at the expense of more traditional qualities. ""I think that's not just an issue for Nasa but our society in generalâ¦ it goes deeply into insurance and pre-existing conditions - whether genetic susceptibility could be considered a pre-existing condition. That is definitely an ethical conversation to be had,"" he says. The findings of the twins study were reassuring in light of space agencies' plans to send humans on a round trip to the Red Planet, which lies 34 million miles from Earth and could take nine months each way. But astronauts will be exposed to around 10 times the radiation dose they would get in Earth orbit - putting them at long-term risk of cancers and other illnesses. ""You'll either have to find a way to shield or get to Mars quicker,"" Kelly says. ""The other option is you just accept the risk."" It's a dilemma you suspect Kelly himself would have considered carefully. He retired from Nasa in 2016, and has since been writing and speaking about his experiences. With his wife, he has since moved from Houston - the hub for Nasa's human spaceflight programme - to Denver. In the four years since he left, new opportunities have opened up for travel into space, and skillsets like his are in demand. The astronaut whose long duration spaceflight record Kelly surpassed - Michael LÃ³pez-AlegrÃ­a - is now set to return from retirement to command a privately-funded flight to the ISS aboard Elon Musk's Crew Dragon vehicle. Despite having achieved so much, it's clear that Kelly's fascination with spaceflight remains undiminished. ""If someone asked me: 'Hey do you want to fly in space?' I'd say: 'Sure, absolutely.' Depending on what I'd be launching on: I wouldn't get into a cannon and launch myself like a cannonball,"" Kelly says. ""It would have to be something that made sense, that was safe. But I wouldn't rule it out. ""If you know anyone out there who has a rocket ship they need pilotingâ¦"" Follow Paul on Twitter. Captain Scott Kelly recently participated in the virtual SafetyCulture summit, sharing his tips for how businesses can succeed in 2021 despite the challenges of the pandemic.

Space images: The best of 2020," There was stunning cosmic imagery to feast on in 2020, from Hubble's 30th birthday image to footage of a daring sample grab on an asteroid. Here's our pick of the year's offerings. The Hubble telescope, one of the most important scientific tools ever built, celebrated its 30th anniversary in April. To mark the occasion, an amazing image was released showing a star-forming region close to our Milky Way galaxy. In this magnificent Hubble portrait, the giant red nebula (NGC 2014) and its smaller blue neighbour (NGC 2020) reside in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way located 163,000 light years away. Nebulas are vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas where star formation can take place. At the heart of NGC 2014 is a clutch of bright stars, which are each 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The image was nicknamed the ""cosmic reef"", because astronomers thought the nebulas resembled an undersea world. A BBC Horizon documentary, broadcast to coincide with the anniversary, showcased stunning 3D visualisations of iconic Hubble images - such as the Pillars of Creation, part of the Eagle Nebula. See also: Hubble telescope's Universe revealed in 3D This year, Nasa's Osiris-Rex performed a daring ""touch-and-go"" manoeuvre with the asteroid Bennu, in order to collect samples of rock and soil for delivery to Earth. Asteroids like Bennu are primitive relics from the dawn of the Solar System. They are the free-roaming building blocks of planets, and offer a window into how worlds like the Earth came into being. In order to collect samples, Osiris-Rex used a long boom with a ring-shaped collection chamber on the end. The spacecraft descended towards Bennu's surface, delivering a squirt of nitrogen when the boom made contact with the asteroid. This was so that the gas would stir up Bennu's surface, allowing fragments of the asteroid to float into the collection chamber. The strategy seems to have worked, as seen in the sequence of images above. Meanwhile, on 5 December, a Japanese mission to collect samples from a different asteroid returned to Earth with its precious cache. The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft released its sample return capsule, which parachuted down safely in the Australian desert. The samples will be analysed at a curation facility in Sagamihara City, Japan. January saw the release of pictures taken by the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) on Hawaii that showed the Sun's surface in unprecedented detail. The images show cell-like structures that are roughly the size of the US state of Texas. They are masses of hot, excited gas, or plasma. The bright areas denote where this material is rising; the dark lanes in-between are where cooler plasma is sinking. DKIST is a brand new facility on HaleakalÄ, a 3,000m-high volcano on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Scientists want to use it to uncover fresh insights into the dynamic behaviour of our parent star, in the hope that they can better forecast its energetic outbursts. These colossal eruptions of charged particles can damage Earth-orbiting satellites, harm astronauts, and even to knock out electrical grids. Launched in 2011, Nasa's Juno spacecraft continues to send back stunning images from the Solar System's biggest planet - Jupiter. The probe captured imagery of the gas giant's swirling cloud decks as it performed its 27th close flyby of the world on 2 June. Citizen scientist Kevin M Gill then transformed the data into a video, which combines 41 still images taken during Juno's close pass. The stills were digitally projected onto a sphere, with a virtual ""camera"" providing views of Jupiter from different angles. Among other things, the footage provides amazing views of Jupiter's most noticeable feature, the giant red spot - which is actually a gigantic ongoing storm. Looking a little like a rocket ship from the golden age of science fiction, Elon Musk's Starship vehicle will - in due course, he hopes - transport humans to the Red Planet. In December, SpaceX tested the first complete prototype of the vehicle, sending it on a 12.5km flight straight up from its pad at the company's Boca Chica facility in South Texas. We're cheating a little with its inclusion here, since the images aren't from space, as such. But we might see it there one day, in the not-too-distant future. The test flight showcased some of the spacecraft's unique features, including its methane-burning Raptor engines and a flight trajectory which includes a belly-facing descent to Earth followed by a flip back to the vertical just before landing. It was at this stage of the test that the Starship prototype, named SN8, approached the pad a little too fast and hard, causing what Musk describes as a RUD - rapid unscheduled disassembly. A crash, in other words. But the flight will have given SpaceX vast amounts of engineering data to chew on, helping them improve the vehicle. And the next prototype - SN9 - is waiting for its turn on the launch pad.

SLS: Crucial test for Nasa's 'mega-rocket'," The core of a giant Nasa rocket that will return astronauts to the Moon has undergone a crucial test. For the first time, engineers fully loaded a core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with super-cold liquid propellant, controlled it and then drained the tanks. That propellant is fuel and an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn.  Engineers wanted to check things worked as expected before the SLS makes its maiden flight in about a year's time. It was part of a testing programme known as the Green Run, that is being carried out at Nasa's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis in Mississippi. This evaluation, known as the wet dress rehearsal (WDR), was the seventh of eight tests on the core stage. Nasa said the rocket responded well to the propellant being loaded. But the test experienced an unexpected shutdown a few minutes earlier than was planned. However, the completion of the WDR should set up the eighth and final test - a ""hotfire"" - where all four RS-25 engines at the base of the core will be fired together for the first time.  Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical testsWhat is Nasa's giant SLS rocket?Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond This very rocket segment will loft the first mission in Nasa's Moon exploration plan - known as Artemis. This mission, which has been scheduled for November 2021, will send the next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around Earth's only natural satellite.  There will be no crew aboard for this test flight. But the third Artemis mission, in 2024, will land the first humans on the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.  The Green Run helps ensure any issues are ironed out before the complex rocket segment is transported to Florida to prepare it for launch. Over the course of several hours, engineers at Stennis loaded the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (roughly 2.6 million litres) of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. ""This is an incredibly exciting time,"" said Jim Maser, senior vice-president at Aerojet Rocketdyne, which builds the RS-25 engines. ""We're really getting to some of the most significant aspects of the testing programme.""  The rocket section is anchored to a giant steel structure called the B-2 test stand, which was once used to test engines for the massive Saturn V rocket that carried astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. The propellant was brought to the site on six barges via the waterway that winds through the grounds of Stennis Space Center. The barges were moored near the test stand while the super-cold (cryogenic) propellants aboard were piped into the core stage. Hydrogen and oxygen are gaseous at room temperature, but gases take up lots of space. Turning them into liquids allows an equivalent amount to be stored in a smaller tank.  This requires the hydrogen fuel to be cooled to minus 253C (minus 423F) and the oxygen (the fuel's oxidiser) to minus 183C (minus 297F).  After being filled, the tanks needed to be topped up - replenished - continually because liquids at such low temperatures boil off over time. During the test, liquids were due to flow through the turbopumps - which feed propellant to the engine combustion chambers - and the engines themselves. This helps prepare the systems to be started. It is all designed to mimic as closely as possible what would happen in the hours prior to a real flight. ""We're just trying to get as much data as we can so that, on the next run, we get further. And we want to find anything that could be improved during this wet dress to prepare for hotfire,"" Ryan McKibben, Green Run test conductor for Nasa, told BBC News. On its Artemis blog, Nasa said: ""First looks at the data indicate the stage performed well during the propellant loading and replenish process."" While all this was happening, teams from Nasa and Boeing - the prime contractor for the SLS - carried out a simulated launch countdown. They were due to take the count all the way to the T-minus (time remaining) 33 seconds point. But Nasa said the test ended a few minutes short of the planned countdown duration. Teams are evaluating the data to pinpoint the exact cause of the early shutdown. Speaking in October, John Shannon, vice president and SLS programme manager at Boeing, explained: ""We'll spend about two weeks looking at the data to make sure all the systems behaved as expected.  ""We'll go out and inspect the vehicle, make sure there are no surprises."" The rocket will stand 98m (322ft) tall in its initial, or Block 1, configurationThe Block 1 SLS can send more than 27 tonnes (59,500 pounds) to lunar orbits - the equivalent of 11 large sports utility vehicles (SUVs) A future version of the SLS, called Block 2 Cargo, will launch 46 tonnes (101,400 pounds) to the Moon - that's 18 large SUVsThe SLS will produce 8.8 million pounds (39.1 Meganewtons) of thrust in its Block 1 configurationFour RS-25 engines sit at the base of the core stage; they're the same ones used in the space shuttle If the data looks good, engineers will proceed with the ""hotfire"". The SLS rocket consists of a huge core stage with two smaller boosters strapped to the sides. The four powerful RS-25 engines at its base are the same type used by the now-retired space shuttle orbiter. The launcher provides the raw power needed to send Orion into space and then hurl it towards the Moon. Last month, engineers at Stennis removed and replaced a component called a clutch on one of four pre-valves, which supply liquid hydrogen to the RS-25 engines. The pre-valve had showed inconsistent performance during tests. Officials have been planning to ship the giant core to its launch site at Florida's Kennedy Space Center by 14 January to keep the SLS on track for its November flight. Last week, Nasa said the Artemis-1 mission remained on track to launch in November 2021 The Green Run has largely proceeded smoothly; there was a five-week stop due to Covid-19. In addition, work at the site had to be shut down six times due to tropical weather, given the particularly active hurricane season. ""It's been extremely important for us to hold the schedule,"" John Honeycutt, SLS manager at Nasa, said during a press conference in October.

Nasa's Mars rover and the 'seven minutes of terror'," The US space agency (Nasa) has released an animation showing how its one-tonne Perseverance rover will land on Mars on 18 February.  The robot is being sent to a crater called Jezero where it will search for evidence of past life. But to undertake this science, it must first touch down softly.  The sequence of manoeuvres needed to land on Mars is often referred to as the ""seven minutes of terror"" - and with good reason. So much has to go right in a frighteningly short space of time or the arriving mission will dig a very big and very expensive new hole in the Red Planet. What's more, it's all autonomous. Blast-off for Nasa mission to detect life on MarsChina's Mars rover rockets away from EarthUAE launches historic first mission to Mars With a distance on the day of 209 million km (130 million miles) between Earth and Mars, every moment and every movement you see in the animation has to be commanded by onboard computers.  It starts more than 100km above Mars where the Perseverance rover will encounter the first wisps of atmosphere. At this point, the vehicle, in its protective capsule, is travelling at 20,000km/h (12,000mph).  In little more than 400 seconds, the descent system has to reduce this velocity to less than 1m/s at the surface. Most of the work is done by a heat shield.  As the capsule plunges deeper into the Martian air, it gets super-hot at more than 1,000C - but at the same time, the drag slows the fall dramatically. By the time the supersonic parachute deploys from the backshell of the capsule, the velocity has already been reduced to 1,200km/h. Perseverance will ride the 21.5m-wide parachute for just over a minute, further scrubbing that entry speed. The most complex phases are still to come, however. At an altitude of 2km, and while moving at 100m/s - the Perseverance rover and its ""Skycrane"" separate from the backshell and fall away. Eight rockets then ignite on the cradle to bring the rover into a hovering position just above the surface. Nylon cords are used to lower the multi-billion-dollar wheeled vehicle to the ground. But that's still not quite it. When Perseverance senses contact, it must immediately sever the cables or it will be dragged behind the crane as the cradle flies away to dispose of itself at a safe distance. The sequence looks much the same as was used to put Nasa's last rover, Curiosity, on the surface of Mars eight years ago. However, the navigation tools have been improved to put Perseverance down in an even more precisely defined landing zone. Touchdown is expected in the late afternoon, local time, on Mars - just before 21:00 GMT on Earth. It's worth remembering that on the day of landing, the time it takes for a radio signal to reach Earth from Mars will be roughly 700 seconds. This means that when Nasa receives the message from Perseverance that it has engaged the top of the atmosphere, the mission will already have been dead or alive on the planet's surface for several minutes.  The robot will be recording its descent on camera and with microphones. The media files will be sent back to Earth after landing - assuming Perseverance survives.

Elon Musk's Starship prototype makes a big impact," US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched the latest prototype of his Starship vehicle from Texas. Codenamed SN8, the uncrewed rocket lifted away from the Boca Chica R&D facility on what had been billed as a brief flight to 12.5km (41,000ft). The 50m-tall vehicle crashed on touchdown but Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved. Before the flight, the tech billionaire had dampened expectations, warning his fans that some mishap was likely. Nonetheless, Musk has big hopes for the Starship when it is fully developed. He says it is the future for his SpaceX company.  Starship will launch people and cargo into orbit, and the entrepreneur also envisages the vehicle travelling to the Moon and Mars. The SpaceX CEO praised his team, adding that the demonstration had acquired ""all the data we needed"". ""Mars, here we come!!"" he tweeted.  SpaceX: Musk's 'Mars ship' prototype aces 150m test flightNasa SpaceX launch: Astronaut crew heads to orbitElon Musk becomes world's second richest person The Boca Chica facility has developed a line of ever-more complex prototypes. The philosophy has been to test each iteration until it fails. Sometimes explosively. SN8 was the first to attempt a high-altitude suborbital flight. The plan had been to demonstrate some manoeuvres that mimicked a belly-facing re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, ending up with a flip back to the vertical just before touchdown. Most of this was achieved: a clean launch off the pad, a steady climb to altitude, followed by a horizontal descent. But it was when the Starship tried to flip back to the vertical that things started to go wrong. The vehicle came into its landing pad with too much speed, and promptly exploded on impact.   ""Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high & RUD,"" Mr Musk explained on Twitter. ""RUD"" stands for ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"". A crash, in other words. Mr Musk will move swiftly on. He already has other prototypes at Boca Chica ready to take SN8's place. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Visually, SN8 looked quite different from the test articles that had gone before it.  The new vehicle was given three of SpaceX's latest methane-burning Raptor engines, a nose cone and aerodynamic control surfaces - the large flaps at its top and base. The Starship will eventually launch atop a booster called the Super Heavy. This will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust. That's much more than even the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon. Both parts of the new SpaceX system - Starship and Super Heavy booster - will stand 118m tall on the launch pad. The two elements are being designed to be fully reusable, making propulsive landings at the end of each mission. In June this year, Mr Musk stated that Starship was now his number-one priority, beyond the Falcon rockets he currently routinely flies for satellite companies, the US Air Force and the US space agency (Nasa). He believes the Starship concept can transform the economics of spaceflight.  The specifications call for more than 100-tonnes to be lifted into low-Earth orbit.  This mass could include satellites, people and even hardware to build bases on the Moon and Mars. Nasa has already asked Mr Musk to examine the possibility of landing a Starship on the lunar surface in the next few years.  The entrepreneur has in mind a higher objective and a faster timeline, however. Receiving an award last week from the Germany digital publishing group Axel Springer SE, he said he aimed to have people at Mars in the next four to six years. The SpaceX CEO is famous for his aggressive and overly optimistic schedules. He does, however, have a habit of proving critics wrong by eventually attaining his goals.

OneWeb satellite company launches into new era," The OneWeb satellite broadband company is back launching again, putting up 36 new satellites on Friday from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Eastern Russia. The spacecraft are to join the 74 already in orbit. OneWeb is now owned principally by the Indian conglomerate Bharti Global and the UK government after they bought the enterprise out of bankruptcy this year. Fifteen more launches of satellites must follow Friday's deployment to complete the internet delivery service. These flights should be occurring on a near-monthly basis from February. ""We will be on track for our 50-degree North service by October next year - so, in 10 months' time. Then, slowly getting to 22 degrees and then global by May or June 2022,"" OneWeb chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal told BBC News. This means, for example, that UK citizens could be using beta broadband connections in the autumn of 2021. OneWeb satellite company is officially rebornConcern over satellite impact on giant telescopeMinisters 'seek alternatives' for UK sat-navOneWeb sale to UK-Bharti group gets court approval The Soyuz rocket carrying the 36 new platforms left the Vostochny pad at 21:26 local time (12:36 GMT). A near four-hour flight saw the spacecraft being dropped off in nine batches of four at an altitude of 450km. All the satellites still need to be manoeuvred into position at the intended operating height of 1,200km above the Earth. OneWeb control rooms in London and in Virginia, US, will oversee this task in the coming months.  Some 650 satellites in total are required for the first generation of the project.  Depending on how the business works out, these spacecraft will be replaced at some point with newer, better technology. OneWeb also has permission to grow the size of its constellation to increase capacity in the network. But the imperative right now is to close the gap in financing for the first generation of the network. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in America wiped out OneWeb's existing debts, and although Bharti Global and the UK government pumped in a combined one billion dollars, there is still roughly $1.4bn-$1.5bn of funding outstanding. Other urgent work concerns the ground stations across the globe that will talk to the satellites and connect them to the internet. These need to be set up at pace.  Also, there is the critical issue of terminals - the devices that customers on the ground use to access the broadband service. OneWeb is working with Intellian Technologies and Collins Aerospace. The intention is not to sell direct to individual consumers but to link them up through telecom partners. And, indeed, the telecom companies themselves are likely to be using the system in the backbones of their mobile phone networks to transfer data.    ""Then there is rural broadband - many schools, hospitals, critical installations in rural areas desperately need this connectivity. They will be spoken to,"" said Mr Mittal.  ""There are large enterprise customers like the cloud providers, such as Amazon or Google. Then you have the UK Ministry of Defence and US Department of Defense, of course. Maritime and aviation, which are really very important, I think is still some time away."" OneWeb is promising a latency (the time taken for a data request to be received) on its broadband network of less than 50 milliseconds, with the highest throughput per beam to a terminal of 400 megabits per second downlink and 100Mbps uplink. OneWeb's chief competitor in the megaconstellation game is Starlink, which is being set up by the Californian rocket company SpaceX. Starlink, which has nearly a thousand satellites in orbit now (the architecture of its network requires more satellites than OneWeb), has already begun beta testing with customers in northern latitudes. It is selling direct to the consumer. Online retailer Amazon is known also to be planning a broadband satellite network and has ample funds through the personal wealth of its CEO and founder, Jeff Bezos, to make it happen. However, very few details about this Kuiper constellation, as it will be called, have so far been released. There is a lot of interest in the UK now to see how the OneWeb project develops.  The manufacturing of the satellites for the first generation is all being done in the US state of Florida by a joint venture set up by OneWeb and the pan-European aerospace giant Airbus. UK industry would like to see some of this work brought onshore - if not for the first generation then, certainly, for the second and later generations of the constellation. ""Investing in OneWeb has been a bold statement by the British government and we're looking forward to seeing how this will benefit the UK industrial sector,"" said Nick Shave who speaks for the umbrella body UKSpace. ""We have seen some different statements from stakeholders, with some saying that work leading into gen-two will be onshored but then those with US interests saying the opposite.""  These concerns about tangible industrial returns on the UK taxpayer's investment were echoed by Volodymyr Levykin, the CEO at Skyrora, the Edinburgh-based rocket company that will shortly start launching from Scotland. ""OneWeb's long-awaited return to launching satellites, as it resumes deployment of its low-Earth orbit constellation, provided a reminder of how much farther the UK government's investment needs to go in order to live up to its 'Made In Britain' billing,"" he told BBC News. ""That OneWeb's satellites are being launched using Russian-made Soyuz rockets and Fregat upper-stage units, from Russian soil - with subsequent launches planned for Russian, Kazakhstan, and French Guiana - and in partnership with French-headquartered Arianespace underlines just how much work remains to be done to achieve the government's stated aim of making the UK a global leader in the space industry."" Mr Mittal has said generation two could look very different, incorporating some sort of PNT (Position, Navigation and Timing) capability and other security-type applications. The Indian businessman has promised also to keep uppermost in his mind the environmental aspects of the project. By this he means not leaving any space junk in orbit and working to remove any interference the satellites might cause to astronomy.  ""We have a commitment to best practice,"" said Chris McLaughlin, chief of government, regulation and engagement matters at OneWeb. ""On those who look to the stars - now that we're back we want to re-engage with that community and talk to them. Our chief technology officer has already been looking at the ways in which we can improve the satellites to reduce their reflectivity, etc.""",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:51:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55365434
Christmas star: Jupiter and Saturn align in the night sky," Jupiter and Saturn have crossed paths in the night sky, appearing to the naked eye as a ""double planet"". The timing of this conjunction, as the celestial event is known, has caused some to suggest it may have been the source of a bright light in the sky 2,000 years ago.  That became known as the Star of Bethlehem.  The planets have been moving closer together each night and reached their closest point on 21 December.  Keen stargazers in the UK have been keeping a close eye on the weather to avoid an astronomical disappointment.  ""Any evening it's clear, it's worth grabbing a chance, because the weather doesn't look great,"" Dr Carolin Crawford from the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy told the BBC.  Given a gap in the winter gloom, both planets would have appeared in the southwest sky, just above the horizon, shortly after sunset.  Some astronomers and theologians think so.  As Prof Eric M Vanden Eykel, a professor of religion from Ferrum College in Virginia, pointed out in an online article the timing hasÂ led to a lot of speculation ""about whether this could be the same astronomical event that the Bible reports led the wise men to Joseph, Mary and the newly born Jesus"". What was the star of Bethlehem?Light pollution's wasted energy seen from spaceJuno snaps giant Jupiter polar storms That is not just modern, festive speculation. The theory that the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn might be the ""Star of Wonder"" was proposed in the early 17th Century byÂ Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer and mathematician. ""2,000 years ago, people were a lot more aware of what was happening in the night sky,"" said Dr Crawford, ""[so] it's not impossible that the Star of Bethlehem was a planetary alignment like this"". As planets cross paths on their journey around the Sun, conjunctions are not particularly rare, but this one is special.  ""Conjunctions are great things to see - they happen fairly often - but [for the planets to be this close] is quite remarkable,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist from the University of Manchester, told BBC News.  The two planets - the largest in the Solar System and some of the brightest objects visible in the night sky - have not been this close to each other in a dark sky for 800 years.  Because of the timing of the planets setting in the southwest, Prof O'Brien said it had been necessary for stargazers to get out and observe the event as soon as the sky went dark. ""None of us is going to be around in another 400 years,"" he said, of the next observing opportunity.

Josef Aschbacher to be next European Space Agency boss," Austrian Josef Aschbacher will be the next director general of the European Space Agency (Esa). Currently in charge of Earth observation at the organisation, his new position was confirmed by a meeting of member states this week. He will take up the post on 1 July, succeeding the German Jan WÃ¶rner, who has been at the helm for five years. Mr Aschbacher said tying down the details of Esa's relationship with the EU would be one of his top priorities. The two organisations are legally separate but are increasingly working hand in glove, with the Paris-based space agency acting as the technical adviser and procurement agent for Brussels' space projects.  'Dog kennel' satellite returns first ocean dataInverted cables doom European Vega rocketUK industry loses out in European satellite bids EU programmes implemented by Esa, such as the Galileo sat-nav system and the Copernicus-Sentinel satellite network, make the European Commission the single largest contributor to the agency's budget - more than any individual member country.  Mr Aschbacher said the current negotiations between Esa and the EC over financing would define the agency for years to come. ""That's something I would like to tackle - of course, realising that we have different member states [some of which] are not a member of the EU,"" he told reporters.  ""So Esa needs to be at the same time, the agency of all its member states, all 22, including the non-EU member states, but at the same time becoming the implementing agency of the European Union space programmes."" In this context, one of Mr Aschbacher's big challenges will be how he handles the UK, which is Esa's fourth-largest (financially) member state but which also now has a fractious relationship with Brussels. London's decision to leave the EU has already seen it drop out of Galileo and the difficulties in striking a trade deal could mean it falls out of Copernicus in the coming weeks as well. Nick Shave, who speaks for the UK space industry umbrella group, UKSpace, said the Esa-EU relationship was critical but that he was hopeful Mr Aschbacher could steer a distinctive path. ""Previous DGs have been proud to keep Esa as an identity. I think that's important,"" he told BBC News. Another of Mr Aschbacher's priorities will be to bring a more commercial approach to the agency's activities. Already, it implements a number of public-private partnerships within its own programmes where commercial concerns bear some of the risk and cost of those activities. But Mr Aschbacher wants this to go further. ""Sometimes people say, 'why does Europe not have a SpaceX?'; 'why does Europe not have a Planet (the private American Earth observation company)?'; or 'why does Europe not have other companies that are really driven largely by the commercial sector?' ""This is something we need to look into. I've some ideas of how this can be done. But, certainly, commercialisation - continuing this effort that we've already started - is something I really would like to focus on,"" he said.   Mr Aschbacher's selection was confirmed at the Council meeting of Esa member states which took place over Wednesday and Thursday.  The meeting also agreed â¬218m (Â£197m) of further funding for Europe's new heavy-lift rocket, Ariane-6. This vehicle is due to make its maiden flight in the second quarter of 2022. And, in addition, there was discussion about the next round of astronaut selection. Esa hasn't recruited new astronaut candidates since 2009.  New applications will be invited at the end of quarter-one next year, with details of how the process will work likely to be released in February. David Parker, the head of human spaceflight at Esa, said 2021 would be a ""super-exciting year"".  ""We discussed the policy aspects of astronauts this week at Council, but we also were able to announce the first mission by one of our astronauts, Matthias Maurer, to the International Space Station next year. His mission is called 'Cosmic Kiss'.  ""It'll be the first time we'll have two astronaut flights to the space station in the same year because, of course, Thomas Pesquet, is going there in the early part of 2021.""

Capella delivers super sharp satellite radar pictures," There is only one way to get persistent vision of the Earth's surface, and that is with satellite radar. Take a look at these images - they're the latest product from the San Francisco start-up Capella Space. The ""spot"" pictures have a resolution on the ground of 50cm by 50cm. This is a first for the commercial marketplace. Capella has a product that's even sharper but it's currently only allowed to sell this to US government customers. It is in the vanguard of companies that is going to open up a new domain in Earth observation. The Helsinki-based Iceye firm has led the way in Europe. And in Asia, the Japanese start-up Synspective launched its first demonstration satellite on Tuesday.  All plan to establish constellations of radar imagers in the sky.  Space radar company chases persistent visionWorld's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edgesSmall radar satellites achieve big capability Spacecraft that use standard optical cameras are frequently stymied by the presence of cloud over the target scene, and of course they can't see anything at night.  But the microwave pulses used in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have no problem piercing the weather, and don't care if the Sun is up or not. What this means is that it will be hard soon for any changes on the planet's surface to go unnoticed.  Radar pictures by their nature aren't always easy to interpret but at the resolution Capella can now capture features on the ground, the task is sure to get easier. ""You don't have to be a SAR expert to look at this imagery and not only appreciate it but also extract really useful information from it, which is what we were going for from the beginning,"" CEO and founder Payam Banazadeh told BBC News. The pictures on this page come from Capella's Sequoia satellite, which was launched in August. It's the pathfinder for the company's constellation. The high resolution is achieved by getting Sequoia to stare at a spot on the ground for a prolonged period. ""As we're going over an area, we can continue essentially keeping the focus of the satellite in the same location for up to 60 seconds,"" Mr Banazadeh explained. ""With that very, very long dwell time, what ends up happening is you get pixel sizes that are in this case much less than 50cm - you end up getting pixels that are in the 5-10cm range. And then when you average all of that, you get a 50cm image, but with very little noise."" Capella has two more spacecraft heading into orbit very soon. Four more are on the production line. All are sub-100kg in size. This is the big breakthrough that the new SAR companies share: they're using the latest electronics to shrink the size and cost of their platforms. This allows them to operate in a field that was once the preserve of Big Government, intelligence agencies and the military. Naturally, it's this grouping that still dominates the market for commercial SAR imagery, but the hope and expectation is that a much broader customer base will eventually open out when people realise what radar can do. ""The biggest markets are the government markets,"" the CEO said. ""What they really want to do is zoom into a location. They want to count features and figure out what they are. And so all that matters is can you zoom in enough? That's just purely a resolution-quality game."" A different type of sector that's getting into SAR in a big way is financial intelligence. Analysts will, for example, watch factories to count trucks to see when new products are being shipped. Capella is also now bouncing Sequoia's data off satellites much higher in the sky that belong to the London-based telecommunications firm Inmarsat. By doing this up-and-down relay, the American start-up doesn't have to wait for Sequoia to pass over a specific ground station to dump its imagery. It can come down in almost real-time instead.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:25:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-55326441
China's Chang'e-5 mission returns Moon samples," China's Chang'e-5 mission has returned to Earth with the cargo of rock and ""soil"" it picked up off the Moon. A capsule carrying the materials landed in Inner Mongolia at 01:59 local time on Thursday (17:59 GMT, Wednesday). It's more than 40 years since the American Apollo and Soviet Luna missions brought their samples home. The new specimens should provide fresh insight on the geology and early history of Earth's satellite. For China, the successful completion of the Chang'e-5 venture will also be seen as another demonstration of the nation's increasing capability in space. Recovery teams were quick to move in on the returned capsule. It was first spotted by helicopters using infrared cameras. Support staff following up in SUVs planted a Chinese flag in the snow-covered grassland next to the module. The woman behind Chang'e-5 missionChina plants its flag on the Moon The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter The Chang'e-5 venture was launched at the end of November.  A probe comprising several elements was sent into orbit around the Moon. These elements then separated, with one half going down to the lunar surface. The lander system used a scoop and a drill to dig up samples. It's not clear how much, but possibly in the range of 2-4kg. An ascent vehicle subsequently carried the materials back into lunar orbit where they were transferred to an Earth-return module. This was shepherded home by a fourth element and released just before it had to make the fiery descent through Earth's atmosphere.  Returning from the Moon, the Chang'e-5 module would have been moving much faster than, say, a capsule coming back from the International Space Station. Engineers had chosen to scrub some of this extra energy by doing an initial ""skip"" in the atmosphere. This saw the module briefly dip into the gases that shroud our planet, before then plunging much deeper to try to reach Earth's surface. The Chang'e-5 capsule was targeted to float down on parachute to Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. This is the same location used to bring Chinese astronauts home.  Again, infrared cameras were on hand to follow the action by detecting the heat of the module. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical testsWater on the Moon could sustain a lunar baseArtemis: To the Moon and Beyond A total of just under 400kg of lunar surface materials were collected by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna landers. But all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. Chang'e-5's rock and dust should be quite different. The Chinese mission targeted a high volcanic region called Mons RÃ¼mker in the northwest of the nearside of the Moon. Samples from this terrain may be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old, and, as such, should provide additional information on how the Moon is constructed internally. The samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the ""chronometer"" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets. This is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this.  Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point. Chinese space officials have said the new samples will be shared with the UN and international partners. The Chinese public will also get to see some of the materials when they are put on display in a national museum. The Moon is once again in vogue. America is planning on returning astronauts to the surface in the middle of this decade. A series of robotic spacecraft will land ahead of these human explorers to do reconnaissance. Some of these probes will be from national space agencies; some will be sent by commercial enterprises - including from the UK. Tony Azzarelli, director and co-founder of the UK industry space body Access Space Alliance, said exciting times lay ahead, and highlighted the start-up Spacebit's quest to put a rover on the lunar surface next year. ""It'll be the first time that a legged robot will walk on another celestial world. Of course, all of these lunar missions are just a prelude to the return of humans to the Moon in the not-too-distant future,"" he told BBC News.

Hayabusa-2: Pieces of an asteroid found inside space capsule," Scientists have been greeted by the sight of jet black chunks of rock and soil from an asteroid after opening a capsule that returned from deep space a week ago. It's the first significant sample of material to be delivered to Earth from a space rock and was grabbed last year by Japan's Hayabusa-2 spacecraft. Researchers began opening the capsule on Monday (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. The material was retrieved from an asteroid called Ryugu. Hayabusa-2 reached the object in June 2018; it is believed to be one of the building blocks left over from the formation of the Solar System. Scientists at the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) curation facility at Sagamihara have now opened one of three sample chambers inside the capsule. Capsule with asteroid samples in 'perfect' shapeRocks from an asteroid set for delivery to EarthAsteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' This was hoped to contain particles of rock and soil from Hayabusa-2's first touchdown on the asteroid in 2019. The spacecraft grabbed the material by firing a tantalum metal bullet into the surface and letting debris float up a collection tube under the low gravity. Scientists had already been excited when they saw black grains from the asteroid caught at the entrance to the sample catcher (where the material is stored) on Monday. And they were not disappointed when they opened it: Inside was material ranging in size from pebbles to tiny particles of dust. Dr Yuichi Tsuda, Hayabusa-2 project manager at Jaxa, told a press conference: ""We have confirmed that the capsule contains a considerable amount of [material] collected from Ryugu. He added: ""The sample of the asteroid extra-terrestrial material that we dreamed about is now in our hands."" However, this is just one of three chambers inside the capsule. Sample chamber B should be empty, but chamber C is thought to hold material collected from beneath Ryugu's surface. Scientists wanted to collect pristine material from Ryugu that had not been altered by exposure to the environment of space - including its radiation - for aeons. In order to do this, they had to use an explosive charge to propel a copper projectile into the surface of the asteroid. This blasted a 20m-wide crater in Ryugu, allowing Hayabusa-2 to descend and grab material ejected from inside the crater, depositing them in chamber C. Scientists should open this chamber in due course. Jaxa has also announced that gas collected from the capsule is from the asteroid. It was likely to have been liberated by the soil collected from Ryugu and is the world's first sample of gas returned from deep space. Asteroids are leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into making rocky worlds like the Earth, but they continued to roam free, rather than being incorporated into planets. Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive class of space rock known as a C-type (or carbonaceous) asteroid. In the early Solar System, such objects could have delivered much of the Earth's water along with the ingredients necessary for life to get started. When the spacecraft arrived at its target in 2018, scientists were surprised by just how dark Ryugu was. Its unexpected hue even forced controllers to adjust the laser altitude sensor used when the spacecraft approached the asteroid's surface. The Hayabusa-2 sample capsule returned to Earth on Saturday 5 December, parachuting down safely in the Australian desert near Woomera.

Hayabusa-2: Capsule with asteroid samples in 'perfect' shape," A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in ""perfect"" shape, according to scientists. The container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT). A recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush. The samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2.  The spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction. The 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere. The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter account reported that the capsule and its parachute had been found at 19:47 GMT. ""Hayabusa-2 is home,"" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. ""We collected the treasure box,"" he said, adding: ""The capsule collection was perfectly done."" Rocks from an asteroid set for delivery to EarthAsteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' He said there was no damage to the container. Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: ""We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true."" Addressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: ""Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development."" The next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos. Earlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region. Screaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position. The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. At around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards. Satoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: ""We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous.  ""We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!"" ""But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise."" The capsule was then taken to a ""quick-look facility"" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Afterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage. The mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu. Japan probe touches down on asteroidNew asteroid rover images released Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would ""reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well"". Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets. ""Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,"" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News. Studying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth. It had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans. The water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth. ""It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. ""Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples."" Researchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material. Dr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: ""Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected."" The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.

Coronavirus variants and mutations: The science explained," The rapid spread of coronavirus variants has put the world on alert and triggered a new lockdown in the UK. What are these variants and why are they causing concern? All viruses naturally mutate over time, and Sars-CoV-2 is no exception. Since the virus was first identified a year ago, thousands of mutations have arisen. The vast majority of mutations are ""passengers"" and will have little impact, says Dr Lucy van Dorp, an expert in the evolution of pathogens at University College London. ""They don't change the behaviour of the virus, they are just carried along."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Are mutations making coronavirus more infectious? But every once in a while, a virus strikes lucky by mutating in a way that helps it survive and reproduce. ""Viruses carrying these mutations can then increase in frequency due to natural selection, given the right epidemiological settings,"" Dr van Dorp says. This is what seems to be happening with the variant that has spread across the UK, known as 202012/01, and a similar, but different variant, recently identified in South Africa (501.V2). There is no evidence so far that either causes more severe disease, but the worry is that health systems will be overwhelmed by a rapid rise in cases. In a rapid risk assessment of these ""variants of concern"", the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said they place increased pressure on health systems. ""Although there is no information that infections with these strains are more severe, due to increased transmissibility, the impact of Covid-19 disease in terms of hospitalisations and deaths is assessed as high, particularly for those in older age groups or with co-morbidities,"" the EU agency said. The variants have different origins but share a mutation in a gene that encodes the spike protein, which the virus uses to latch on to and enter human cells. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? UK has two cases of variant found in South Africa  Scientists think this could be why they appear more infectious. ""The UK and South African virus variants have changes in the spike gene consistent with the possibility that they are more infectious,"" says Prof Lawrence Young at the University of Warwick. But as Dr Jeff Barrett, director of the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, points out, it's the combination of what the virus is doing and what we're doing that determines how fast it spreads. ""With the new variant, the situation changes more quickly as restrictions are relaxed and tightened, and there is less room for error in controlling the spread,"" he says.  ""We don't have any evidence, however, that the new variant can fundamentally evade masks, social distancing, or the other interventions - we just need to apply them more strictly."" With vaccine roll-out underway, scientists are racing to understand the repercussions for vaccines, which are based on the spike protein sequence. There is particular concern about the South Africa variant, which has several changes in the spike (S) protein.  Most experts think vaccines will still be effective, at least in the short term. Dr Julian W Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, says vaccines can be modified to be ""more close-fitting and effective against this variant in a few months"".  ""Meanwhile, most of us believe that the existing vaccines are likely to work to some extent to reduce infection/ transmission rates and severe disease against both the UK and South African variants - as the various mutations have not altered the S protein shape that the current vaccine-induced antibodies will not bind at all."" Scientists are carrying out laboratory studies to find out more about the variants. And they are tracking every move of the virus as it hopscotches around the world. By taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the virus can be extracted and amplified before being ""read"" using a sequencer. The string of letters, or nucleotides, allows genomes and mutations to be compared. ""It is thanks to these efforts, and UK testing laboratories, that the UK variant has been flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern,"" Dr van Dorp says. Prof Julian Hiscox, chair in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, says that, through the efforts of scientists to sequence the virus, ""we've got a really good handle on variants that emerge"". In the short-term, only the harshest of lockdowns will reduce case numbers, he says. ""What lockdown does is reduce the number of people with the virus and reduce the amount of virus out there and that's a good thing."" But in the long term, Prof Hiscox suspects, we may face a scenario like flu, where new vaccines are developed and administered every year. ""The problem is, the more variants we get, the greater the chance the virus will be able to escape part of the vaccine - and this may reduce [its] efficacy,"" he says.

A few years back I spent almost an hour discussing exactly this with him. To mark his new milestone we decided to dust the interview off and share it with you. So here is Elon Musk's guide to success in business.  This is absolutely central to Elon Musk's attitude to business.   When I interviewed him in 2014 he said he didn't know how rich he was.   ""It's not as if there is a pile of cash somewhere,"" he said. ""It's really just that I have a certain number of votes in Tesla, and SpaceX, and SolarCity, and the marketplace has value on those votes.""   He doesn't have anything against the pursuit of wealth ""if it's done in sort of an ethical and good manner"", but said it just isn't what drives him.  The approach certainly seems to be working.   The real-life inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark of Iron Man fame was worth perhaps $10bn when we spoke in 2014.  His electric car company, Tesla, has performed particularly well. Shares have surged over the past year to take its value to more than $700bn. For that you could buy Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, and still have enough left over to buy Ferrari. But Musk, who turns 50 this year, doesn't expect to die rich. He said he thinks most of his money will be spent building a base on Mars, and wouldn't be surprised if the project consumed his entire fortune. In fact, like Bill Gates, he would probably regard ending his life with billions in the bank as a mark of failure because he hadn't put that money to good use. That Mars base is a clue to what Elon Musk believes is the key to success.   ""You want things in the future to be better,"" he told me. ""You want these new exciting things that make life better."" Take SpaceX. He told me he set the company up because he was frustrated the US space programme wasn't more ambitious.   ""I kept expecting us to advance beyond Earth, and to put a person on Mars, and have a base on the moon, and have, you know, very frequent flights to orbit,"" he said. When that didn't happen, he came up with the idea for the ""Mars Oasis Mission"", which aimed to send a small greenhouse to the red planet. The idea was to get people excited about space again, and persuade the US government to increase Nasa's budget. It was while he was trying to get that off the ground he realised the problem wasn't ""a lack of will, but rather a lack of way"" - space technology was far more expensive than it needed to be. Et voila! The world's cheapest rocket-launching business was born. And here's the important thing, its genesis wasn't about making money, but landing a person on Mars.   Musk told me he regards himself as an engineer rather than an investor, and says what gets him up in the morning is the desire to solve technical problems.   It is that, rather than dollars in the bank, that is his yardstick of progress. He knows every hurdle his businesses overcome helps everyone else who's trying to solve the same problem - and it does it forever. That's why, shortly before we met, the entrepreneur had announced he was going to open up all Tesla's patents to speed up the development of electric vehicles worldwide.   How Elon Musk plans to revolutionise battery technologyElon Musk's vision for autonomous vehicles One of the really striking things about Elon Musk's businesses is how audacious they are.   He wants to revolutionise the car industry, colonise Mars, build super-fast trains in vacuum tunnels, integrate AI into human brains and upend the solar power and battery industries.   There's a common thread here. All of his projects are the kind of futuristic fantasies you'd find in a kid's magazine in the early 1980s.   Put it like this, his tunnelling business is called The Boring Company. Musk makes no secret of the fact he was inspired by the books and movies he consumed as a kid in South Africa. Which brings us to Musk's third business tip - don't hold back. He believes low ambition is baked into most companies' incentive structures. Too many companies are ""incrementalist"", he said. ""If you're the CEO of a big company and you aim for something that's a modest improvement, and it takes longer than expected, and doesn't work out quite as well, then nobody's gonna blame you,"" he told me. You can say it wasn't my fault, it was the suppliers.  If you are bold, and go for a really breakthrough improvement, and it doesn't work, you're definitely going to get fired, he argues. He says this is why most companies focus on making small improvements to their existing products rather than daring to imagine completely new ones.   So, his advice is to make sure you are working on what he calls ""stuff that's going to matter"".   Two things stand out in Musk's personal hierarchy of stuff that matters. First, he wants to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels.   Here's what the entrepreneur had to say about that: ""We're drawing upon deep gas fields and deep oil fields that haven't seen the light of day since the Cambrian era. If the last time something saw light was when the most complex organism was a sponge, you really have to question whether that is a wise move."" Second, he wants to ensure the long-term survival of humanity by colonising Mars and ""making life multiplanetary"". Like I say, think big. This one is obvious. You've got to have skin in the game to do well, but Elon Musk has taken more risks than most. By 2002 he had sold off his holdings in his first two ventures, an internet city guide called Zip2 and the online payment company PayPal. He had just entered his 30s and had almost $200m in the bank.  He says his plan was to put half his fortune into the businesses and keep the other half.  Things didn't work out like that. When I met him, he was just emerging from the darkest period of his business life.  His new companies faced all sorts of teething troubles. SpaceX's first three launches had failed, and Tesla had all manner of production problems, and supply chain, and design issues.   Then the financial crisis struck. Musk said he faced a stark choice. ""I could either keep the money, then the companies are definitely going to die, or invest what I have left and maybe there is a chance."" He kept pouring in money. At one point he was so in debt he had to borrow money from friends just to pay his living expenses, he told me.   So, did the prospect of bankruptcy frighten him?   He says it didn't: ""My kids might have to go to a sort of government school. I mean big deal, I went to a government school."" What really shocked him - and it was clear in 2014 he was still very upset by it - was the delight many pundits and commentators took in his travails.   ""The liberal schadenfreude was really quite astonishing,"" said Musk. ""There were multiple blog sites maintaining a Tesla death watch."" I suggested people may have wanted him to fail because there's a kind of arrogance about his ambition. He rejected that. ""I think it would be arrogant if we said we were definitely going to do it, as opposed to we're aspiring to do it, and we're going to give it our best shot."" This brings us to Musk's next lesson in business success - don't listen to the critics. He told me he didn't believe SpaceX or Tesla would ever make money when he set them up - and the truth is nor did anyone else. But he ignored the doomsters and went ahead anyway.  Why? Remember, this is a man who judges success on the basis of the important problems he's solved, not how much money he has made. Think how liberating that is. He isn't worried about looking stupid because his big financial bet hasn't paid off, what he cares about is pursuing important ideas.  It makes decision making much simpler because he can stay focused on what he believes really matters.  And the market seems to like what he's doing.   In October, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley valued SpaceX at $100bn.   The company has transformed the economics of space flight, but what will make Musk most proud will be how his company has reinvigorated the US space programme.  Last year his Crew Dragon rockets launched six astronauts to the International Space Station, the first such missions from US soil since the space shuttles were retired in 2011. Follow this guide and, with a bit of luck, you'll become impossibly rich and famous too. Then you can start to come out of your shell. Elon Musk is famously a workaholic - he boasts of working 120-hour weeks to keep production of the Tesla Model 3 on track - but since we met he seems to have been enjoying himself. He has stoked controversy with defamation lawsuits, on-air dope smoking and wild outbursts on social media.   In 2018 he ran into trouble with the US financial regulator when he tweeted that he was planning to take Tesla private, and when the Covid-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shut down production at its San Francisco Bay Area factory, he became a vocal opponent of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.   He called panic over the virus ""dumb"" on Twitter, and described stay-at-home orders as ""forcible imprisonment"", saying they were ""fascist"" and a breach of constitutional rights.   In the summer he announced plans to sell off his physical possessions saying they ""weigh you down"".   Days later he took to Twitter to tell the world his newborn son would be called X Ã A-12 Musk. Yet his unpredictable behaviour doesn't seem to have affected his businesses, and the entrepreneur remains as ambitious as ever. In September, Musk claimed Tesla would have a ""compelling"" $25,000 car within three years, and said soon all the company's new cars would be completely self-driving. And his year ended with a real bang in December, when SpaceX tested its Starship launch vehicle, which it hopes will take the first humans to Mars.   The giant rocket exploded when it crash landed six minutes after lift-off.   Elon Musk hailed the test as an ""awesome"" success.

How Ugandan Nasa scientist Catherine Nakalembe uses satellites to boost farming," As a keen badminton player Ugandan Catherine Nakalembe wanted to study sport science at university but a failure to get the required grades for a government grant set her on a path that led her to Nasa and winning a prestigious food research prize, writes the BBC's Patience Atuhaire. When Dr Nakalembe tried to explain to a Karamojong farmer in north-eastern Uganda how her work using images taken from satellites hundreds of kilometres above the Earth relates to his small plot, he laughed.  While she uses the high-resolution images in her pioneering work to help farmers and governments make better decisions, she still needs to get on the ground to sharpen up the data.  In other words, from space you cannot tell the difference between grass, maize and sorghum.  ""Through a translator, I told the farmer that when I look at the data, I just see green. ""I had printed a picture, which I showed him. He was then able to understand thatâ¦ you need to see the farm physically to make those distinctions,"" the academic tells the BBC.  She is a softly spoken woman with a radiant demeanour, and it is hard to picture her trekking for hours in the heat of semi-arid Karamoja, looking to tease out the granular distinctions that can only be spotted on the ground.  This is especially important in farming areas dominated by small holders who may be planting different crops at different times, leading to a huge number of variables. That complexity makes it almost impossible for most authorities to monitor.  Dr Nakalembe, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland's geographical sciences department in the US, uses the satellite data to study agriculture and weather patterns.  That information is combined with data gathered on the ground about the crops and their condition to build a model that learns to recognise patterns to help make predictions.  It was this that won her the 2020 Africa Food Prize alongside Burkina Faso's Dr AndrÃ© Bationo for his work on fertiliser. The scientist, who also heads the Africa section of Nasa's food and agriculture programme, explains: ""From the air, you can see which area is built-up, bare, has vegetation or water.  ""We are also able to tell what is cropland or what is forest. Because we have a 30-year record of what cropland looks like, we can tell what is healthy, what isn't or which part has improved.""  Using information gathered on the ground by researchers or sent in by farmers themselves, she can then distinguish between crop types and create a map that shows whether the farms are thriving compared to the same crop elsewhere in that region.  The model has been used in places like the US where mechanised farming takes place on an industrial scale. The information can help inform decisions about when to irrigate or how much fertiliser should be used.  But even a farmer in Uganda, or elsewhere on the continent, using just a hoe and working for long hours on their small plot will find this information valuable.  ""Remote sensing makes it possible to monitor large swathes of land using freely available data.  ""You can give a forecast; if you combine satellite estimates of rainfall and temperature, you can tell that it is going to rain in the next 10 days and farmers should prepare their fields. Or if there is no rain, they don't have to waste their seeds and can wait a few weeks,"" Dr Nakalembe says.  In much of the continent, where farms are often small fragmented plots far from sources of information, this data can be translated into local-language text messages, radio programmes or passed on through agricultural extension workers.  It is also evidence that governments can use to plan for disaster response in case of crop failure or flash floods, and save communities from famine.  Early research by Dr Nakalembe enabled 84,000 people in Karamoja avoid the worst effects of a highly variable climate and a lack of rainfall.  ""She worked with us in 2016, to develop tools that predict the incidence of drought,"" says Stella Sengendo, who works on disaster risk in the prime minister's office.  ""We use these to estimate the number of households that are likely to be affected by severe dry spells. We then developed a programme that extends funds to families, through the local government.  ""Locals do public works and earn money during the dry season. They save 30% and use 70% for daily consumption,"" Ms Sengendo explains.  The 5,500 Uganda shilling ($1.50, Â£1.12) a day is a lifeline for families in a region that has only one harvest season a year. And about 60% of these workers are women, who, studies have shown, suffer the worst effects of climate change.  Brought up in the capital, Kampala, by a mother who runs a restaurant and a father who is a mechanic, Dr Nakalembe never pictured herself working with satellites.  She played badminton with her sisters and wanted to pursue sports science as a degree, but without the required grades to get a government grant, she turned to environmental science at Makerere University.  Having never left Kampala except for the occasional family event, she applied to work with the Uganda Wildlife Authority to earn credits for her course.  ""Mapping appealed to me. I went to Mount Elgon in the east. I still have pictures from my very first field work because it was really exciting,"" she says, beaming.  The Nasa scientist, who now travels throughout Africa training government departments on how to develop food security programmes, went on to Johns Hopkins University for a masters in geography and environmental engineering.  She says: ""I have always had the same personal statement: to gain knowledge and apply it back home.  ""The PhD program at the University of Maryland allowed me to get into remote sensing, but most importantly, come and work in Uganda and around the continent.""  The trailblazing researcher also mentors young black women to encourage them to get into environmental sciences.  ""In the diaspora, I go to meetings and I am the only one who looks like this. It feels lonely when it is a new country or space.  ""In East Africa, I meet a lot of people with whom we can share experiences and our struggles. I would like to see more black women in this group,"" says Dr Nakalembe, sounding determined.  The news that she had won the 2020 Africa Food Prize this September came to her in a patchy phone call. She did not know that she had been nominated, and wondered why her colleagues insisted she kept her phone close.  When the call finally came, she was asked to hold for former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who barely got through the congratulations before the line was disconnected.  ""It was like going to the hospital for a headache and then being told you're having a baby. ""When I called my family, my sister thought I was being scammed. My mother said the same thing she always says whenever I achieve something: 'Webale kusoma' ('thank you for studying hard' in Luganda),"" she says.  The euphoria from the win has clearly yet to wear off, judging by the big grin with which she talks about the prize.  ""Imagine, I now have a Wikipedia page.  ""When I introduce myself lately, I have to remember to say: 'I am also the 2020 Africa Food Prize Laureate'. And I've got my giant trophy which weighs about 5kg. So, I know I am not dreaming,"" she quips.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 01:04:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55333624

DeepMind's AI agent MuZero could turbocharge YouTube," DeepMind's latest AI program can attain ""superhuman performance"" in tasks without needing to be given the rules. Like the research hub's earlier artificial intelligence agents, MuZero achieved mastery in dozens of old Atari video games, chess, and the Asian board games of Go and Shogi. But unlike its predecessors, it had to work out their rules for itself. It is already being put to practical use to find a new way to encode videos, which could slash YouTube's costs. ""The real world is messy and complicated, and no-one gives us a rulebook for how it works,"" DeepMind's principal research scientist David Silver told the BBC. ""Yet humans are able formulate plans and strategies about what to do next. ""For the first time, we actually have a system which is able to build its own understanding of how the world works, and use that understanding to do this kind of sophisticated look-ahead planning that you've previously seen for games like chess. ""[It] can start from nothing, and just through trial and error both discover the rules of the world and use those rules to achieve kind of superhuman performance."" Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and a member of the government's AI council, said the work marked a ""significant step forward"", but raised concerns. ""The results of DeepMind's work are quite astounding and I marvel at what they are going to be able to achieve in the future given the resources they have available to them,"" she said. ""My worry is that whilst constantly striving to improve the performance of their algorithms and apply the results for the benefit of society, the teams at DeepMind are not putting as much effort into thinking through potential unintended consequences of their work. ""I doubt the inventors of the jet engine were thinking about global pollution when they were working on their inventions. We must get that balance right in the development of AI technology."" London-based DeepMind first published details of MuZero in 2019, but waited until the publication of a paper in the journal Nature to discuss it. It represents the firm's latest success in deep reinforcement learning - a technique that use many-layered neural networks to let machines teach themselves new skills via a process of trial and error, receiving ""rewards"" for success rather than being told what to do. MuZero follows in the footsteps of: a program referred to as DQN, which achieved human-beating proficiency in Atari video games using only pixels and game scores as inputAlphaGo, the program which beat master Go player Lee-Sedol 4-1 in a groundbreaking competition in 2016, after being trained on past gamesAlphaGo Zero, which surpassed AlphaGo in performance the following year after training itself from scratch having only been provided with the basic rules of the gameAlphaZero, which in 2017 generalised AlphaGo Zero so that it could be applied to others games, including chess and Shogi Most recently, DeepMind - which is owned by the same parent as Google's - made a breakthrough in protein folding by adapting these techniques, which could pave the way to new drugs to fight disease. MuZero could soon be put to practical use too. Dr Silver said DeepMind was already using it to try to invent a new kind of video compression. ""If you look at data traffic on the internet, the majority of it is video, so if you can compress video more effectively you can make massive savings,"" he explained. ""And initial experiments with MuZero show you can actually make quite significant gains, which we're quite excited about."" He declined to be drawn on when or how Google might put this to use beyond saying more details would be released in the new year. However, as Google owns the world's biggest video-sharing platform - YouTube - it has the potential to be a big money-saver. DeepMind is not the first to try and create an agent that both models the dynamics of the environment it is placed in and carries out tree searches - deciding how to proceed by looking several steps ahead to determine the best outcome. However, previous attempts have struggled to deal with the complexity of ""visually rich"" challenges, such as those posed by old video games like Ms Pac-Man. The firm believes it has been successful because MuZero only tries to model aspects of the environment that are important to its decision-making process, rather taking a wider approach. ""Knowing an umbrella will keep you dry is more useful to know than modelling the pattern of raindrops in the air,"" it explains in a blog. The Nature paper reports that MuZero proved to be slightly better than AlphaZero at playing Go, despite doing less tree-search computation per move. And it said it also outperformed R2D2 - the leading Atari-playing algorithm that does not model the world - at 42 of the 57 games tested on the old console. Moreover, it did so after completing just half the amount of training steps. Both achievements point to the fact that MuZero is effectively able to squeeze out more insight from less data than had been possible before, explained Dr Silver. ""Imagine you've got a robot and it's wandering about in the real world and it's expensive to run,"" he said. ""So you want it to learn as much as possible from the small number of experiences it has. MuZero is able to do that."" He added that other potential uses included next-generation virtual assistants, personalised medicine and search-and-rescue technologies.",BBC News - Science & Environment,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:00:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55403473
The best science long reads of 2020," It was a year when scientists tried to solve the mystery of rogue orcas attacking boats and the pandemic shed light on our increasingly strained relationship with nature. If you want to delve deeper into some of the big science and environment stories of the year, here's a selection of this year's long reads.  How Joe Biden plans to tackle climate change. By Matt McGrath Joe Biden's plan to tackle climate change has been described as the most ambitious of any mainstream US presidential candidate yet. Matt McGrath considers what he wants to do, and how he might get it done. Why summers could become too hot for humans. By David Shukman Global warming will increase the chances of summer conditions that may be ""too hot for humans"" to work in, experts say. These conditions could expose millions of people to dangerous levels of heat stress - a dangerous condition which can cause organs to shut down. Are we too anxious about the risks of radiation? By Justin Rowlatt This year has seen renewed interest in nuclear power from the UK government. Though it's classed as a renewable form of power, nuclear energy has its critics. So is it time to reassess our attitude to nuclear power? Justin Rowlatt reports. Have rogue orcas been attacking boats in the Atlantic? By Victoria Gill In the past six months there have been at least 40 reported incidents of orcas attacking boats off the coasts of Spain and Portugal. What's behind the unusual behaviour of these sea mammals? Five charts about the biggest carbon crash. By Matt McGrath No war, recession, or previous pandemic has had such a dramatic impact on emissions of CO2 over the past century as Covid-19 has in a few short months. Matt McGrath examined the massive impact on our environment caused by the Covid crisis, and explained why it's also likely to have little effect on long-term patterns.  Covid: Why bats are not to blame. By Helen Briggs Bats have been scapegoated by humans for centuries, with Covid only the latest example, say scientists. According to many experts, it's our increasing level of interference with these wild creatures that's at the root of the problem. Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? By Roger Harrabin The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed? How to survive a year in space.

Covid: Wuhan scientist would 'welcome' visit probing lab leak theory," A Chinese scientist at the centre of unsubstantiated claims that the coronavirus leaked from her laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan has told the BBC she is open to ""any kind of visit"" to rule it out. The surprise statement from Prof Shi Zhengli comes as a World Health Organization team prepares to travel to Wuhan next month to begin its investigation into the origins of Covid-19.  The remote district of Tongguan, in China's south-western province of Yunnan, is hard to reach at the best of times. But when a BBC team tried to visit recently, it was impossible.  Plain-clothes police officers and other officials in unmarked cars followed us for miles along the narrow, bumpy roads, stopping when we did, backtracking with us when we were forced to turn around. We found obstacles in our way, including a ""broken-down"" lorry, which locals confirmed had been placed across the road a few minutes before we arrived. And we ran into checkpoints at which unidentified men told us their job was to keep us out.  At first sight, all of this might seem like a disproportionate effort given our intended destination, a nondescript, abandoned copper mine in which, back in 2012, six workers succumbed to a mystery illness that eventually claimed the lives of three of them. But their tragedy, which would otherwise almost certainly have been largely forgotten, has been given new meaning by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Those three deaths are now at the centre of a major scientific controversy about the origins of the virus and the question of whether it came from nature, or from a laboratory. And the attempts of Chinese authorities to stop us reaching the site are a sign of how hard they're working to control the narrative. WHO to investigate Covid origins in China's WuhanChina and the virus that threatens everythingWuhan city of silence For more than a decade, the rolling, jungle-covered hills in Yunnan - and the cave systems within - have been the focus of a giant scientific field study. It has been led by Prof Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).  Prof Shi won international acclaim for her discovery that the illness known as Sars, which killed more than 700 people in 2003, was caused by a virus that probably came from a species of bat in a Yunnan cave.  Ever since, Prof Shi - often referred to as ""China's Batwoman"" - has been in the vanguard of a project to try to predict and prevent further such outbreaks. By trapping bats, taking faecal samples from them, and then carrying those samples back to the lab in Wuhan, 1,600km (1,000 miles) away, the team behind the project has identified hundreds of new bat coronaviruses. But the fact that Wuhan is now home to the world's leading coronavirus research facility, as well as the first city to be ravaged by a pandemic outbreak of a deadly new one, has fuelled suspicion that the two things are connected. The Chinese government, the WIV, and Prof Shi have all angrily dismissed the allegation of a virus leak from the Wuhan lab. But with scientists appointed by the World Health Organization (WHO) scheduled to visit Wuhan in January for an inquiry into the origin of the pandemic, Prof Shi - who has given few interviews since the pandemic began - answered a number of BBC questions by email. ""I have communicated with the WHO experts twice,"" she wrote, when asked if an investigation might help rule out a lab leak and end the speculation. ""I have personally and clearly expressed that I would welcome them to visit the WIV,"" she said. To a follow-up question about whether that would include a formal investigation with access to the WIV's experimental data and laboratory records, Prof Shi said: ""I would personally welcome any form of visit based on an open, transparent, trusting, reliable and reasonable dialogue. But the specific plan is not decided by me."" The BBC subsequently received a call from the WIV's press office, saying that Prof Shi was speaking in a personal capacity and her answers had not been approved by the WIV. The BBC denied a request to send the press office a copy of this article in advance. Many scientists believe that by far the most likely scenario is that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, jumped naturally from bats to humans, possibly via an intermediary species. And despite Prof Shi's offer, for now there appears to be little chance of the WHO inquiry looking into the lab-leak theory. The terms of reference for the WHO inquiry make no mention of the theory, and some members of the 10-person team have all but ruled it out. Peter Daszak, a British zoologist, has been chosen as part of the team because of his leading role in a multimillion dollar, international project to sample wild viruses. It has involved close collaboration with Prof Shi Zhengli in her mass sampling of bats in China, and Dr Daszak previously called the lab-leak theory a ""conspiracy theory"" and ""pure baloney"". ""I've yet to see any evidence at all of a lab leak or a lab involvement in this outbreak,"" he said. ""I have seen substantial evidence that these are naturally occurring phenomena driven by human encroachment into wildlife habitat, which is clearly on display across south-east Asia."" Asked about seeking access to the Wuhan lab to rule the lab-leak theory out, he said: ""That's not my job to do that. ""The WHO negotiated the terms of reference, and they say we're going to follow the evidence, and that's what we've got to do,"" he added. One focus of the inquiry will be a market in Wuhan which was known to be trading in wildlife and was linked to a number of early cases, though the Chinese authorities appear to have already discounted it as a source of the virus.  Dr Daszak said the WHO team would ""look at those clusters of cases, look at the contacts, look at where the animals in the market have come from and see where that takes us"". The deaths of the three Tongguan workers following exposure to a mineshaft full of bats raised suspicions that they'd succumbed to a bat coronavirus. It was exactly the kind of animal-to-human ""spillover"" that was driving the WIV to sample and test bats in Yunnan. It is no surprise then that, following those deaths, the WIV scientists began sampling bats in the Tongguan mineshaft in earnest, making multiple visits over the next three years and detecting 293 coronaviruses. But apart from one brief paper, very little was published about the viruses they collected on those trips. In January this year, Prof Shi Zhengli became one of the first people in the world to sequence Sars-Cov-2, which was already spreading rapidly through the streets and homes of her city. She then compared the long string of letters representing the virus's unique genetic code with the extensive library of other viruses collected and stored over the years. And she discovered that her database contained the closest known relative of Sars-Cov-2.  RaTG13 is a virus whose name has been derived from the bat it was extracted from (Rhinolophus affinis, Ra), the place it was found (Tongguan, TG), and the year it was identified, 2013.  Seven years after it was found in that mineshaft, RaTG13 was about to become one of the most hotly contested scientific subjects of our time. There have been many well-documented cases of viruses leaking from labs. The first Sars virus, for example, leaked twice from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing in 2004, long after the outbreak had been brought under control. The practice of genetically manipulating viruses is also not new, allowing scientists to make them more infectious or more deadly, so they can assess the threat and, perhaps, develop treatments or vaccines. And from the moment it was isolated and sequenced, scientists have been struck by the remarkable ability of Sars-Cov-2 to infect humans. The possibility that it acquired that ability as a result of manipulation in a laboratory was taken seriously enough for an influential group of international scientists to address it head on. In what has become the definitive paper ruling out the possibility of a lab leak, RaTG13 has a starring role. Published in March in the magazine Nature Medicine, it suggests that if there had been a leak, Prof Shi Zhengli would have found a much closer match in her database than RaTG13. While RaTG13 is the closest known relative - at 96.2% similarity - it is still too distant to have been manipulated and changed into Sars-Cov-2. Sars-Cov-2, the authors concluded, was likely to have gained its unique efficiency through a long, undetected period of circulation in humans or animals of a natural and milder precursor virus that eventually evolved into the potent, deadly form first detected in Wuhan in 2019. Where though, some scientists are beginning to wonder, are those reservoirs of earlier natural infection? Dr Daniel Lucey is a physician and infectious disease professor at the Georgetown Medical Centre in Washington DC and a veteran of many pandemics - Sars in China, Ebola in Africa, Zika in Brazil. He is certain that China has already conducted thorough searches for evidence of precursor viruses in stored human samples in hospitals and in animal populations. ""They have the capability, they have the resources and they have the motivation, so of course they've done the studies in animals and in humans,"" he said. Finding the origin of an outbreak was vital, he said, not just for wider scientific understanding, but also to stop it emerging again. ""We should search until we find it. I think it's findable and I think it's quite possible it's already been found,"" he said.  ""But then the question arises, why hasn't it been disclosed?"" Dr Lucey still believes that Sars-Cov-2 is most likely to have a natural origin, but he does not want the alternatives to be so readily ruled out. ""So here we are, 12, 13 months out since the first recognised case of Covid-19 and we haven't found the animal source,"" he said. ""So, to me, it's all the more reason to investigate alternative explanations."" Might a Chinese laboratory have had a virus they were working on that was genetically closer to Sars-Cov-2, and would they tell us now if they did? ""Not everything that's done is published,"" Dr Lucey said. It's a point I put to Peter Daszak, the member of the WHO origins study team. ""You know, I've worked with the WIV for a good decade or more,"" he said. ""I know some of the people there pretty well and I have visited the labs frequently, I've met and had dinner with them over 15 years. ""I'm working in China with eyes wide open, and I'm racking my brain back in time for the slightest hint of something untoward. And I've never seen that."" Asked if those friendships and funding relationships with the WIV presented a conflict of interest with his role on the inquiry, he said: ""We file our papers; it's all there for everyone to see.""  And his collaboration with the WIV, he said, ""makes me one of the people on the planet who knows the most about the origins of these bat coronaviruses in China"". China may have provided only limited data about its hunt for the origin of Sars-Cov-2, but it has begun to promote a theory of its own. Based on a few inconclusive studies conducted by scientists in Europe that suggest Covid-19 may have been circulating earlier than previously thought, state propaganda is full of stories suggesting the virus didn't start in China at all. In the absence of proper data, speculation is only likely to grow, much of it focused on RaTG13 and its origins in a Tongguan mineshaft. Old academic papers have been dug up online that appear to differ from the WIV's statements about the sick mine workers - among them a thesis by a student at the Kunming Hospital University. ""I've just downloaded the Kunming Hospital University student's masters thesis and read it,"" Prof Shi told the BBC.  ""The narrative doesn't make sense,"" she said. ""The conclusion is neither based on evidence nor logic. But it's used by conspiracy theorists to doubt me. If you were me, what you would do?"" Prof Shi has also faced questions about why the WIV's online public database of viruses was suddenly taken offline.  She told the BBC that the WIV's website and the staff's work emails and personal emails had been attacked, and the database taken offline for security reasons. ""All our research results are published in English journals in the form of papers,"" she said.  ""Virus sequences are saved in the [US-run] GenBank database too. It's completely transparent. We have nothing to hide."" There are important questions to be asked in the Yunnan countryside, not just by scientists, but by journalists too. After a decade of sampling and experimenting on viruses collected from bats, we now know that back in 2013 the closest known ancestor was discovered of a future threat that would claim well over a million lives and devastate the global economy. Yet the WIV, according to the published information, did nothing with it, except sequence it and enter it into a database. Ought that to call into question the very premise on which the expensive, and some would say risky, mass sampling of wild viruses is based? ""To say that we didn't do enough is absolutely correct,"" Peter Daszak told the BBC. ""To say that we failed is not fair at all. What we should have been doing is 10 times the amount of work on these viruses."" Both Dr Daszak and Prof Shi are adamant that pandemic prevention research is vital, urgent work. ""Our research is forward-looking, and it's difficult for non-professionals to understand,"" Prof Shi wrote by email. ""In the face of countless micro-organisms that exist in nature, we humans are very small."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know?Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The WHO is promising an ""open-minded"" inquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, but the Chinese government is not keen on questions, at least not from journalists. After leaving Tongguan, the BBC team tried to drive a few hours north to the cave where Prof Shi carried out her ground-breaking research on Sars almost a decade ago. Still being followed by several unmarked cars, we hit another roadblock, and were told there was no way through. A few hours later, we discovered that local traffic had been diverted onto a dirt track that skirted the obstruction, but as we attempted to use the same route, we met yet another ""broken down"" car in our path. We were trapped in a field for over an hour, before finally being forced to head for the airport.

Ivory: Elephant decline revealed by shipwreck cargo," Researchers have examined ancient DNA preserved in elephant tusks that were among the cargo of a 487-year-old shipwreck. Their forensic examination of the 100 tusks pinpointed the devastation caused to the elephant population by centuries of ivory trade.  On this single ship, researchers found genetic evidence  of 17 distinct herds of the threatened animals.  Today, scientists can find only four of those herds surviving in Africa.  The tusks were so well preserved - in cold water off the Namibian coast - that scientists were even able to find out what type of diet the elephants had, which revealed where they had lived and been hunted.  The findings are published in the journal Current Biology.  The wreck itself is a Portuguese trading vessel, known as theÂ Bom Jesus, which went missing on its way to India in 1533. It was found by chance in 2008 in a coastal diamond mine, making it the oldest known shipwreck in southern Africa.Â  The ivory in the cargo hold was just part of a vast haul of precious cargo, including copper ingots and gold and silver coins. Archaeologists have also found personal effects and navigation equipment amid the remains of the ship.  ""There are dinner plates, cutlery and trinket boxes, as well as all the copper ingots, coins and ivory in the cargo,"" explained Ashley Coutu, an archaeologist from the University of Oxford, who specialises in genetic and chemical analysis of artefacts.  ""It is an incredible find, incredibly well preserved,"" she told BBC News.  That preservation meant that the international team of researchers - including experts from from Namibia, the US and the UK - could unpick exactly how many herds of elephants the tusks came from.  The team examined something called mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are the power stations of every cell, converting food into fuel. And crucially for this study, the genetic blueprint that makes mitochondria is passed down from mother to offspring.  This makes it a particularly revealing piece of code for elephants.  ""Elephants live in female-led family groups, and they tend to stay in the same geographic area throughout their lives,"" explained Alida de Flamingh from the University ofÂ IllinoisÂ at Urbana-Champaign, who led the study. ""We were able to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes from these really old samples."" Those completed pieces of genetic code showed that the tusks on this single trading vessel came from 17 distinct elephant herds. The most up to date genetic information about the elephants surviving in that part of Africa today showed that only four of those could be found.    ""That was quite shocking - that loss of diversity,"" said Dr Coutu. ""Next we'd really like to fill in those gaps in a chronological way. We can look at where these pinch points are in  history and create a timeline of exactly how and when the huge trade in ivory had an impact.""  ""[What we found] definitely has conservation implications,"" Dr de Flamingh added: ""We know that a loss of genetic diversity is associated with increased extinction risk.""  Every tusk is an elephant's life story. What the animals eat creates a fingerprint in the composition of the tusks as they grow - something that scientists can unpick using a technique called isotope analysis.  This essentially breaks down the chemical make-up of every tusk, and it suggested that these were forest elephants - living in mixed forest habitat. That was a surprise, because by this point in history the Portuguese had established trade with the Kongo Kingdom and communities along the Congo River. So the researchers expected that elephants would be from different regions, especially West and Central Africa. The scientists also hope their detailed examination of this ancient ivory could help inform anti-poaching efforts today. While recent analysis shows elephant poaching has declined slightly, conservationists say the animals are still being poached at unsustainable rates and the trade is a threat to their survival. When large-scale confiscations of illegal ivory take place, people analyse the DNA to find out where the elephants were killed in Africa.  ""Our evidence provides a reference to compare that with, so its origin can be confirmed,"" said Dr de Flamingh. ""And once you know where the ivory is from you can develop targeted anti-poaching strategies for those locations."" Dr Coutu added: ""We're really going to be able to use this historic data to answer modern conservation questions.""

'World's ugliest orchid' tops list of new discoveries," The ""ugliest orchid in the world"" and British mushrooms are among a list of new species named by scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and their collaborators in 2020. Experts say the ""weird and wonderful"" plants and fungi highlight the incredible diversity of species still to be found and documented. A third of the new species are orchids. But scientists were surprised to find six new British toadstools, including one growing near Heathrow Airport. Ten fascinating facts about fungi Pollution hits fungi that nourish trees The most unlikely discovery was a toadstool growing among trees beside a reservoir at Heathrow Airport, which was found by fungi expert Andy Overall. ""It's reddish-brown, doesn't blow your socks off to look at, but it's a special thing,"" he told BBC News. Experts at Kew examined the specimen, and DNA studies later confirmed that it was new to science. He has named the toadstool, Cortinarius heatherae, after his wife Heather. Two more species were found in England, one at Devil's Dyke in Sussex and the other in woods near Barrow-in-Furness. Three new Scottish species were also identified; one at Caithness in the Highlands and two in the Black Wood of Rannoch. All six species belong to a prolific group of fungi, known as web caps because they are covered by a cap of threads resembling spiders' webs. The toadstools live in harmony with trees, helping the likes of oak, beech, birch and pine absorb water and nutrients. Kew expert Tuula Niskanen found two of the Scottish species, including Cortinarius aurae, which she named after her daughter, Aura. ""You don't need to go to the Amazon or Africa to find new fungi, you can find them close to you,"" she told BBC News. ""Even in London you can find new species."" She said it was important to find and name new fungal species so that they can be better understood and protected. We have a ""Stone Age"" level of knowledge about fungi compared with that of plants and animals, she added. New plants and fungi are still being discovered around the world, at the rate of about 2,000 a year. Scientists at Kew and their collaborators have named and published scientific details of 156 species this year. Of these 27 are fungi, including six from the UK.  Dr Martin Cheek, a senior scientist at Kew, said there has been a bumper list of incredible newly named species this year. ""It's pretty sensational to have six new species to science from the UK and it would only ever happen with fungi because of the fungi on our planet we know such a minute proportion of them."" A third of the new species are orchids. A total of 19 orchids were found on the island of New Guinea, which is a hotspot of biodiversity.  Another orchid, with small, brown flowers, was found in a forest in Madagascar. Kew scientists described it as ""the ugliest orchid in the world"". Other discoveries by scientists at Kew include: A Peruvian plant related to the sweet potato which could be a future food source.A strange scaly shrub that grows in arid regions of Namibia. The plant has scaly leaves and grows in hot natural sand pans. Fewer than 1,000 individual plants remain. A Brazilian plant related to the pineapple, which is pollinated by hummingbirds. The bromeliad lives on a limestone cliff in central Brazil but is at risk due to extraction of limestone to make cement. A shrub related to the blueberry found near the world's largest gold mine in Indonesian New Guinea.  A herb with medicinal properties found in a forest on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

Climate change: 700-year history of wind recorded in island mud," Scientists have reconstructed a 700-year history of how westerly winds have blown around the Southern Hemisphere. It's a remarkable record that's written in the muds at the bottom of a small lake on the remote Marion Island in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. What this history reveals is that the strength and latitude of the westerlies is tied closely to temperature. And the implication is that the winds will likely intensify and move poleward as the climate warms. ""What we're seeing in this lake record is that these westerly winds are highly mobile and sensitive to really quite small changes in temperature, and this has some big implications for what the future of our planet looks like,"" Dr Bianca Perren from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) told BBC News. The westerly winds - known by latitude as the roaring forties, furious fifties, and screaming sixties - are hugely influential.  Poo sediments record 'penguin Pompeii''Doomsday Glacier' vulnerability seen in new mapsClimate secrets of the world's most remote island The position of their core belt is linked to drought and wildfire potential on southern landmasses; they also regulate the Southern Ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide and heat by churning its waters; and in recent decades the winds have reshaped the distribution of sea-ice around Antarctica, and have become implicated in the melting of the west of the White Continent by driving warm water under floating glacier fronts. But, you might ask: how does a lake on Marion Island retain a record of these westerly winds? The answer is in the chemistry of its sediments. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, it kicks up a salty spray. When this lands on the island lake, it makes the lake water more saline. This, in turn, alters the biology in the lake, favouring only those tiny algal species, or diatoms, that can tolerate the new salty environment. The stronger the winds, the more salt spray and the more challenging are the conditions in the lake. What this means is that when the scientists drill into the mud at the bottom of the lake, dating its layers and identifying the remains of the dominant species of diatoms through time, they get a multi-century ""proxy"" for the strength of the winds blowing over Marion Island. When this information is combined with other climate records around the Southern Hemisphere, what emerges is a fascinating picture. It shows that during cool periods in recent Earth history, such as the so-called Little Ice Age (roughly AD 1400-1870), the core belt of the winds weakened and shifted towards the equator.  During warm periods, on the other hand (before 1450 and after 1920), the core intensified and migrated poleward. Since the 1960s, instrumental records have documented a continuation of the poleward migration and intensification of the main belt winds - most probably as a result of the atmospheric changes induced by the loss of stratospheric ozone, which was caused by human-produced chemicals that have subsequently been banned.  The question now is whether, as the ozone hole is repaired, global warming steps in to renew and harden the trend. Computer models will take this new information and refine their forecasts. ""This research gives us a little window into what the westerly winds have been doing in the past, and what we can anticipate in the future,"" said Dr Perren. Co-author Dr Dominic Hodgson, also at BAS, added: ""With the rapid changes now occurring in the Earth's climate it is especially important that we use historical data to increase the accuracy of our climate models.  ""This study has revealed the behaviour of the westerly winds long before satellites and on the ground measurements began.  ""It shows us that climate warming drives moisture bearing winds southwards away from Australia, South America and South Africa. The immediate human consequences of this are increased droughts and wildfires.""

Silencing Trump: How 'big tech' is taking Trumpism offline," If you ever needed proof of the power of ""Big Tech"" then the downfall of Parler on Monday morning is a good place to start. I, like many others, logged on to the controversial social network to see what would happen after 11:59 Pacific Time in the US. This was the deadline Amazon had given the app to find a new host service before it booted the platform offline for allegedly containing violent content. It was being seen as a significant moment in ongoing efforts by US tech giants to ""deplatform"" Donald Trump and some of his extreme supporters after the US Capitol Hill riot last week. Trumpâs Twitter downfall The clock struck 12:00 though and nothing happened. I and millions of other users were still able to search and post just as usual. But then, like dominos, users around the world starting reporting problems. For me, at about 12:10, everything stopped working. No content found, a message read.  With a flick of a switch then, Parler, a fast-growing app seen by some as a free-speech alternative to Twitter, was no more. For now. Parler can, and probably will be able to, find a new host provider but losing Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the largest website hosting provider in the world - means other major providers are likely to turn away their business too. Technology and ethics researcher Stephanie Hare says it's not the first time a major US tech firm has taken a site down for similar reasons. ""Amazon's action against Parler is not unprecedented, as we have seen other US companies such as Cloudflare remove content delivery services and DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) protection and support to white supremacist website The Daily Stormer in 2017 and 8Chan in 2019 after that website was used by a gunman to post materials before he went on to massacre people in El Paso, Texas,"" she said. It's not just AWS which has taken action against Parler. Google and Apple have also kicked the service off their app stores too. Again, this is not unheard of.  Gab, another website billing itself as a free-speech platform but accused of being a haven to the far-right and extremists, is also banned from the app stores. It can still be accessed through a web browser and claims to have seen a surge in users in recent days. And as part a crackdown on accounts associated with the attack on Congress, on Monday Twitter announced it has shut down ""more than 70,000 accounts"" linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory.  What is unprecedented though is the targeted approach against the president. Since Mr Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol last week, he has been banned from using some of the biggest social platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch. YouTube has deleted some of his videos but said his channel is effectively on its last chance. European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have described the move as ""problematic"". EU commissioner Thierry Breton described the events on Capitol Hill as ""the 9/11 moment of social media"", writing in Politico that ""the fact that a CEO can pull the plug on Potus' [President of the United States] loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing"". UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social networks were now ""taking editorial decisions"", adding that platforms were ""choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice"". Elsewhere, Alexei Navalny, Russian politician and outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, likened Mr Trump's ban on Twitter to state censorship. He tweeted: ""The ban of Donald Trump on Twitter is an unacceptable act of censorship. Of course, Twitter is a private company, but we have seen many examples in Russia and China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and the enablers when it comes to censorship."" The fact is, social networks are private companies. Just as a private members' club can make house rules for its members, so can the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter. One of the key rules imposed has been, until now, to consider politicians' content important to public discourse. Platforms including Facebook and Twitter said they would therefore give high-profile users like the US president more leeway when it comes to violating user policies. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic things have changed significantly and the companies have taken increased action against world leaders. In March, Facebook and Twitter deleted posts from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro for Covid-19 misinformation. It wasn't until May that Twitter took similar action against the US president when moderators put a warning behind a tweet that they said glorified violence. The president tweeted about the Black Lives Matter protests saying: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts"". Social media commentator Matt Navarra says Mr Trump's ban sets ""a pivotal precedent"" in the way platforms control who can use them and what users can post. Some analysts think the action may be a turning point for tech moderation worldwide. On Monday Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts it says were directly linked to the Ugandan government, and being used to allegedly manipulate the forthcoming election. Privacy attorney and technologist Whitney Merrill suggests the move points to a change in moderation stance from the tech giants.  ""Social networks' rules and guidelines are evolving over time which is normal. But they aren't being consistently applied throughout the world. I think the president's removal might be the beginning of a purge for similar behaviour globally."" In his final hours on Twitter, Mr Trump once again blamed a piece of US legislation called Section 230 for ""banning"" free speech. During his presidency he threatened to repeal the law which makes social networks largely exempt from liability for their users' post. Many argue that removing the protection would actually harm free speech as networks would be forced to moderate far more than they currently do. US President-elect Joe Biden has also stated that he would like to repeal the law to increase moderation and reduce the spread of fake news. In the same final tweet Mr Trump said that he has been negotiating with ""various other sites"" and that there would be ""a big announcement soon"". If the events of recent days are anything to go by, Mr Trump and some of his supporters face an uphill struggle against not just lawmakers but tech giants too before they can establish themselves on mainstream social media.",BBC News - Technology,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 03:23:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55624630
Elon Musk's Starlink given green light in UK," Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service is already being used by a handful of people across the UK. The company began rolling out a limited trial last month, it has emerged, after Ofcom granted it a licence in November.  It will compete against providers such as OneWeb, which government investment controversially saved from bankruptcy in November.  Telecom analysts said the competition could help drive down the price of satellite broadband for consumers. Business Secretary Alok Sharma had to issue a ""ministerial direction"" to push forward the investment in OneWeb, after civil servants stated their objection, with critics questioning why ministers would invest so much money in what remains a risky venture.  OneWeb satellite company launches into new eraOneWeb satellite company is officially reborn Mr Musk plans to deliver broadband internet around the world, using 42,000 satellites.  His Space X company has launched more than 800 into orbit already and hopes to have 12,000 in the sky by 2026.  Starlink began testing its small satellite dishes, dubbed Dishy McFlatFace, in North America and Canada.  UK consumers will pay Â£439 for the gear and a further Â£84 a month to receive Starlink's broadband.  ""The early pricing we've seen is probably too high for mass adoption,"" telecoms analyst Matthew Howett told BBC News.  ""However, the likely competition between Starlink and OneWeb might help it become a more affordable option for consumers."" Zen Internet founder Richard Tang said the service could also benefit those living in remote areas of the UK.  ""It could help to alleviate the UKâs remote-area connectivity issue and support those in the middle of nowhere who canât get conventional high-speed broadband."" Last month, MPs warned the government would fail to achieve a target of offering 1Gbps-capable broadband to 85% of the UK by 2025. Initially, it had aimed for nationwide coverage within five years. But that targets was scaled back after it emerged only 25% of the promised Â£5bn funding would be available, at least for the next four years.",BBC News - Technology,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 17:59:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55625071
Parler social network sues Amazon for pulling support," Parler has hit back after Amazon pulled support for its so-called ""free speech"" social network. Parler is suing the tech giant, accusing it of breaking anti-trust laws by removing it. Parler had been reliant on the tech giant's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service to provide its alternative to Twitter. The platform was popular among supporters of Donald Trump, although the president is not a user. Amazon took the action after finding dozens of posts on the service that it said encouraged violence. In response, the platform has asked a federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate it. ""AWS's decision to effectively terminate Parler's account is apparently motivated by political animus,"" the complaint reads. ""It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter."" Google and Apple had already removed Parler from their app stores towards the end of last week saying it had failed to comply with their content-moderation requirements. However, it had still been accessible via the web - although visitors had complained of being unable to create new accounts over the weekend, without which it was not possible to view its content. Parler has been online since 2018, and may return if it can find an alternative host. However, chief executive John Matze told Fox News on Sunday that ""every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too"". ""We're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't,"" he added. AWS's move is the latest in a series of actions affecting social media following the rioting on Capitol Hill last week. Facebook and Twitter have also banned President Trump's accounts on their platforms, citing concerns that he might incite further violence. Parler's users included the Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who had led an effort in the Senate to delay certifying Joe Biden's electoral college victory. He had about five million followers on the platform - more than his tally on Twitter. ""Why should a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires have a monopoly on political speech?"" he tweeted over the weekend. However, Amazon told Parler that it had seen a ""steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms"", adding that it did not believe the platform's administrators had an ""effective process"" that could tackle the problem. Examples it provided include posts calling for the killing of Democrats, Muslims, Black Lives Matter leaders, and mainstream media journalists. Parler's downfall appears to have benefited Gab - another ""free speech"" social network that is popular with far-right commentators. It has claimed to have ""gained more users in the past two days than we did in our first two years of existing"".  Parler has long been a home for what you might call untouchables, people who had been excluded from mainstream services for offences such as blatant racism or incitement to violence. During a brief excursion onto the site over the weekend, I observed plenty of examples of such behaviour, with users exhibiting vile anti-Semitism, displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika and uttering incoherent threats against those they perceive to be enemies of America.  But as Amazon's deadline approached something like panic took hold, with users desperately urging their followers to join them on other platforms.  Most seemed to accept that Parler was doomed, while vowing to continue their fight elsewhere.  ""Well this is the end,"" wrote one user, who proclaimed his support for the American Nazi Party.",BBC News - Technology,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:01:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55615214

Primary school programming will be on CBBC, with two hours for secondary pupils on BBC Two.  During the first lockdown, content was available on iPlayer, Red Button services and online, but not on regular TV channels, although viewers in Scotland did have some programming. BT said the move was part of its wider Lockdown Learning programme.

Covid-19: The challenges of home-schooling," A mother wakes at dawn to copy out worksheets for her children on to pieces of paper. Secondary school pupils attempt to write essays on their mobile phones, while younger children queue to wait their turn on the one computer in the house. That, according to the Child Poverty Action Group, was the reality of remote learning in some homes in the first UK lockdown in March 2020. ""We spoke to thousands of parents, carers and children and the thing we heard was that up to  40% of them did not only not have access to a laptop or the internet, but also to other things like printers, even stationery and craft materials,"" said Kate Anstey, a project lead at the charity. Now, as we enter another lockdown that could last until the February half-term or beyond, the government wants even more online learning - with schools mandated to provide at least three hours per day and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson calling on parents to report schools who are not providing enough resources. How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again)Lockdown Learning: What's the BBC doing to help children?How parents plan to tackle home-schooling It is estimated that 2.6 million schoolchildren live below the poverty line in England alone, and Ofcom estimates that about 9% of children in the UK - between 1.1 million and 1.8 million - do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home. More than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection. Businesses and charities are helping out. The London Grid for Learning (LGfL) has a scheme called Bridge the Divide, which is leading a nationwide procurement scheme for two million cheap Chromebooks and WinBooks. And to help those without devices, the government has sent out more than half a million laptops to the schools in most need.  But the government help ""isn't going far enough,"" thinks Ms Anstey, and even when laptops are arriving, the problems aren't over.  ""We have heard from schools that have had laptops, but they have arrived without the right software,"" she said. To help parents struggling to afford data, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone are planning free access to the Oak National Academy online lessons, so that families can continue to learn from home without using any of their mobile data allowance until the end of the academic year. The networks are completing their technical tests over the coming weeks before rolling it out. Do what you can. You don't have to become a teacher. You are a parent and what your child needs most is what parents give best - love and support.  Provide a structure to the day - this does not need to be a strict timetable. And for younger children, keep the afternoons free for more fun activities, craft, cooking, PE. If you can, set up a small workstation for your child. Headphones could help for online lessons. If you have a Playstation or Xbox, but not an extra computer, both Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom can be accessed via the consoles. Talking and reading don't need devices - and both are vital skills. Practise the basics, like multiplication tables, playing with money, or imaginative role-play. Matt Lawson lives in Cumbria and has four children of school age. His broadband and mobile signal is so bad that he has to rely on the schools his children attend sending work by post. For his daughter, studying for GCSEs it is particularly hard. ""She was also involved in a lot of clubs which are carrying on on Zoom so she can't join in. It is ridiculous."" Some schools are ahead of the game because they embraced the digital curriculum before the pandemic. Phil Hedger is chief executive of the LEO Academy Trust, a group of six schools in the London Borough of Sutton. Back in 2018, it decided to provide every child with a Chromebook, and in lockdown has found children have thrived because they were used to the technology. ""What works online is high-quality short bursts of teacher-led learning for 15 or 20 minutes, and then offline activities,"" he said. Not all lessons the school provides are live. Some are pre-recorded and there is a plethora of excellent resources already online from places such as BBC Bitesize for teachers to draw on. One Monday, the BBC is also launching curriculum-based programmes for primary and secondary school children, on terrestrial TV channels CBBC and BBC Two. If teachers do provide live lessons, they stay online afterwards to help children who are struggling.  And children know the etiquette of video conferencing, including how to mute themselves and even setting up their own meetings to support their peers. For children without access to the internet, the school provides dongles for a mobile connection. Jonty Clark is chief executive of the Beckmead Trust, which caters for 400 vulnerable children with complex needs. He took matters into his own hands and secured funding from two charities to supply laptops and dongles to both their own and partner schools at the beginning of the first lockdown. It paid dividends. Some of the older children were ""already involved with the justice system"", he said, and having laptops has kept them off the streets and stopped them offending. And for some children, such as those with autism, working at home on a laptop has seen them ""flourish"" academically. I'm just coming up for air after painstakingly copying 17 circles divided into various fractions on to a piece of paper for my seven-year-old to colour in because yup, my printer has packed up. My children are both in primary school. We have yet to have any ""live"" lessons - instead we get pre-recorded videos, Powerpoint presentations and other materials shared on Google Classroom. They also have to play online maths and spelling games. The boys have separate log-ins and are in different years, so need at least one device each. Because there is still a focus on handwriting, I have to submit photos of their work. This is proving tricky because their Google Classroom log-ins do not enable me to access my own Google drive . So far, I am emailing photos to myself from my phone, putting them on my desktop and then uploading them from there. My nine-year-old declares that he is doing more work in home-school than he did in ""real"" school - although he is delighted with his new-found knowledge that he can look up ""naughty words"" in the dictionary. It feels like half-term is a long way away. ""The last few days have been some of the most stressful of my life,"" one parent, who didn't want to be named, told the BBC. Both he and his wife work full-time, but now have to fit in live spelling lessons, Powerpoint presentations and spreadsheets. In desperation at the sheer workload, he has had to turn to his 60-year-old mother for help. She has previously had health issues, so the solution is not without risk. Parenting expert Harriet Shearsmith thinks families should take the resources from schools but adapt them to their own routine and the needs of their child. With a five-year-old, an eight-year-old and a nine-year-old, she summed up the frustration of many. ""Today I spent 90 minutes on a maths sheet looking at a long multiplication which I didn't even get myself. ""It is all well and good to say children have to learn for three hours, but I challenge the MPs who came up with this to make three different children work for three hours while doing your own job.""",BBC News - Technology,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 01:19:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55573803
CES 2021: The tech expo swaps Vegas for a virtual show," Under normal circumstances this would have been one of the busiest weeks in the tech calendar. Thousands of new products would have been unveiled; chief executives and celebrities would have vied for attention; and robots would have probably malfunctioned on stage. But the coronavirus pandemic meant the giant CES tech expo could not be held in Las Vegas, and it has instead slipped later than normal to an online-only event, beginning on Monday. There will still be lots of new gadgets. New kinds of TVs, vacuum cleaners which throw away their own waste, and computer monitors specifically designed for Microsoft Teams work chats, are among products to have been teased in advance. But the shift to a virtual event means much of the buzz will inevitably be lost. ""Seeing products in real life and networking are without a doubt the two biggest reasons to attend CES and it will be very hard to replicate these two digitally,"" Carolina Milanesi, an industry analyst, told the BBC. ""One of the aspects of the show floor I always appreciated was walking around to find hidden gems, companies I never heard of that had great products. This is impossible to do scrolling down a catalogue list."" One consequence is that there will be a bigger focus on the stage presentations and panels. In 2020, a session with Ivanka Trump drew the most headlines - not least because event organiser Gary Shapiro had once penned a blog warning the Republicans of President Trump's ""racism and inanity"". This time around, the incoming Biden administration will be chewed over at length.  In addition, Microsoft's president Brad Smith is giving his company's first keynote address at CES in nearly a decade, and General Motors' chief Mary Barra is set to reveal more about its driverless car plans. Two years ago, in a BBC interview, Mr Shapiro floated the idea of a disease one day making it impossible for attendees to meet in person.  He described it as being a ""dystopian"" idea.  He explained how - with the pandemic - CES has been forced to change, and he examined what the long-term consequences for the consumer gadget show might be. The interview below has been edited for brevity and clarity. It took place shortly before rioters stormed Congress. We've clearly had to adapt, but it's given us an opportunity to reimagine CES. It's allowed us to shift the date a week later into the year to allow a little more planning and flexibility. We haven't been able to do that in Las Vegas for several years. And it's allowed us to extend the life of the show as we're keeping everything online for 30 days, so people can discover exhibits, listen to conferences and watch them at their own pace. We have 1,800 exhibits or so right now to visit, and we're reviewing as much of the content as we can before it's put up there. What we can't recreate is the beauty and magic of Las Vegas and the five-senses experience. It's sad. But this is an opportunity. We're all flexible. We're humans. We'll get through it. And we'll be better off for it. What do you think will be the standout products and themes? There's a tremendous amount on 5G connectivity. Digital health is also very big.  Artificial intelligence is increasingly important as we try to figure out cures to Covid. But it's also important in solving many other problems of the world to make it safer, healthier and more efficient.  And the concept of smart cities may be changing as people discover they can work from home and live where they want - and maybe the best idea is not tall buildings with windows that don't open. Microsoft's back doing a keynote for the first time since 2012. How has that come about?  We've had a great relationship with Microsoft for years and Bill Gates did a keynote almost every year when he was a CEO.  Brad Smith is speaking, which is great. I know him well. He has a vision of getting broadband out there to more people - and that's important, as we've seen with the pandemic.  We might even have someone else from Microsoft. Stay tuned. The event is happening against the backdrop of rising tensions between the US and China. In the last week, we saw President Trump ban Alipay and other Chinese apps, and there's still a shadow looming over TikTok. Looking at your exhibitors this year, a lot of big Chinese names who have been part of CES in the recent past are missing: the drone-maker DJI, the smartphone-makers Huawei and ZTE, car start-up Byton, and tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. What's the consequences of them breaking with CES and a wider schism? Well, I don't know there's a schism. But the West-and-China relationship is clearly deteriorating. China's definitely getting more aggressive politically and militarily. There's concerns, obviously, that the Trump administration has taken a very aggressive approach on China. But on the other hand, we still make a lot of products there, though a lot of our companies have shifted elsewhere in the world, including Vietnam.  Looking forward to the Biden administration, we're focused on a more predictable, more friendly-to-our-allies relationship. That's something that's important to us.  In terms of Chinese exhibitors, we do have significant big ones like HiSense, Haier and Lenovo. But I've heard that the Chinese government is not financially supporting some of the smaller companies, which they used to do. But frankly, our goal was to showcase 1,000 companies, and we're approaching 2,000. I don't think we can handle any more. One of the other changes expected under the Biden administration is a greener agenda. Now it has a majority in Congress and the Senate too that could be a big boost for the electric car sector. Definitely there's a green focus, I'm pretty sure the US will get back into the Paris Accord one way or another. Our industry is committed to meeting or exceeding the Paris guidelines. Products including electric cars have already gone a long way. But look at all the technology that's in your home now, and how electricity usage goes down over time with almost every product as it moves into later generations.  Other areas of difference between the Trump and Biden administrations are over highly-skilled immigration and tariffs as a tool. We are looking forward to some significant changes. Our success as Americans is really dependent upon our ability to innovate, to attract highly-skilled people, to invest in research and development, and to have the free market. Attacking some of our own best global companies is probably not the best strategy, and Trump has been relentless at fighting with the tech industry and not being very supportive in many ways.  On the other hand, his administration has supported the key areas of development including AI, self-driving, robotics, and other emerging technologies. There's also speculation that the Biden administration will be tougher on big tech in regard to regulation. As the leader of one of the big lobbying organisations, what will you be saying to the Biden administration about that? Well we represent 2,000 American technology companies, including US subsidiaries of foreign companies.  We don't oppose regulation. We want regulation. We want to know what the the guardrails are, so we can produce legal products and follow the law. The big challenge is Congress isn't that good at passing clear laws. They're usually compromises that are ambiguous. And there are political footballs with each new administration. You have ambitious lawyers trying to create names for themselves and bring all sorts of novel lawsuits. We're concerned about politicians trying to unravel deals approved 10 years ago. It's absurd saying that the large companies should not be allowed to buy small companies. It would dry up investment capital. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists want an exit. They want either internal growth, a public offering, or an acquisition. The reason innovation attracts so much litigation is because if you are successful as an innovator, it means you are creating something better, and someone is shifting their business to you. We're seeing that in industries such as broadcast, the motion picture industry, the hotel industry, the taxi industry. They're saying: ""You're putting us out of business because you're providing something better to consumers.""  And yes, that's the free market capitalist system.  Now, it should be that everyone has to play in a sense by the same rules. But those rules shouldn't be driven to keep out new businesses. Otherwise we'd still be going around our streets with horse-drawn carriages, rather than automobiles or electric scooters. Finally, to bring this back to CES, do you think the event will be back to normal in 2022? Or do you think big trade shows like yours will never be the same? I think a lot of things in life will never be the same. But they will be better.  The number one takeaway is everyone's going to be more hygienic. And certainly, events will be more hygienic.  But I think there's a there's a thirst for human contact. It may not be hugs and handshakes right away. And hopefully there'll be other events before ours so we can see the best practices. But we will be different.  We've already spaced out our floor plan for next year, we'll have wider aisles. We're paying attention to a lot of things that we really didn't focus on before. And then of course, I think there'll be a hangover of some type, depending how vaccines play out and how different countries open up.  All I know is every CEO I talk to has this thirst to get together. My hope is that restaurants can open up, that we could have local fairs, and do all the things we used to do.

China's Baidu and Geely partner up for smart cars," Chinaâs search engine Baidu has announced it will partner with carmaker Geely to make smart electric vehicles (EVs).  Baidu will provide âintelligent driving capabilitiesâ, while Geely will offer design and manufacturing expertise.   Geely is one of Chinaâs largest carmakers, and also owns Volvo and a stake in Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler.  The two companies will be competing not just with Elon Musk's Tesla, but also with several Chinese competitors.  âWe believe that by combining Baidu's expertise in smart transportation, connected vehicles and autonomous driving with Geely's expertise as a leading automobile and EV manufacturer, the new partnership will pave the way for future passenger vehicles,"" said Robin Li, co-founder and chief executive of Baidu.

Baidu established its autonomous driving unit Apollo in 2017, which mainly supplies technology powered by artificial intelligence and works with a number of international and Chinese carmakers China is the worldâs leading market for electric vehicles.  According to the International Energy Agency, there were 7.2 million electric cars on the road globally by 2019, with 47% of them in China.  Data provider S&P Platts estimates that ânew energy vehiclesâ will account for 20% of total new car sales in China by 2025.  âChina has become the world's largest market for EVs, and we are seeing EV consumers demanding next generation vehicles to be more intelligent,"" Mr Li said.   Baidu and Geely are likely to face strong competition, with carmakers and tech giants globally trying to develop smart cars.  Internet giants including Tencent, Amazon and Alphabet have all developed auto-related technology or invested in smart-car startups in recent years. Chinaâs e-commerce giant Alibaba has formed an EV joint venture with Geelyâs competitor SAIC.  Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing has partnered with automaker BYD to make electric vehicles specifically designed for ride hailing services. The announcement follows reports of a possible electric car tie-up with Apple and Hyundai.  Shares of the South Korean car company surged by more than 20% on Friday after it initially said it was in the ""early stage"" of talks with the iPhone maker about a possible electric car partnership. But hours later it backtracked and said it was talking with a number of potential partners without naming Apple. A report in Korea IT News on Sunday said the two companies planned to sign a deal by March and start production around 2024.

Trump Twitter ban 'raises regulation questions' - Hancock," Bans imposed by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Donald Trump's accounts raise a ""very big question"" about how social media is regulated, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The companies acted after supporters of the US president stormed Washington DC's Capitol building on Wednesday. Mr Hancock said the bans showed they were now ""taking editorial decisions"". Campaigners want social media to be treated as ""publishers"", rather than ""platforms"", meaning more regulation. But opponents of the idea argue that it could allow governments to limit debate. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riotsTrump to take 'big action' against social mediaMore powers for Ofcom to police social media firms Mr Trump faces an impeachment charge, with Democrats accusing the Republican president of encouraging the Washington riots, in which five people died. Twitter permanently suspended his @realDonaldTrump account on Saturday, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". But Mr Trump called this an attack on free speech and suggested he would look at ""building out our own platform in the future"". There has been a long-running debate over whether social media companies should be treated in law as ""publishers"", with greater responsibility for dealing with libellous, discriminatory, misleading or incendiary content posted by users. Mr Hancock, a former culture secretary, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump - the scenes at the Capitol - were terrible - and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. ""But there's something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That's clear because they're choosing who should and shouldn't have a voice on their platform."" Mr Hancock said that development was likely to have ""consequences"". Asked earlier about Twitter's decision to ban Mr Trump's account, he told Sky News: ""I think it raises a very important question, which is it means that the social media platforms are taking editorial decisions. ""And that is a very big question because then it raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they're regulated."" Twitter's ban on Mr Trump's account followed the increasing use of warning labels on his posts referring to the coronavirus pandemic and the result of the US presidential election. In a blog on Friday, the company said its public interest framework existed ""to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly"". It added: ""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement."" Facebook and Instagram banned Mr Trump ""indefinitely"" on Thursday, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying this sanction would not be lifted until at least 20 January, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the new US president.",BBC News - Technology,"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 13:44:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55609903
Sex workers say 'defunding Pornhub' puts their livelihoods at risk," Credit card giants Visa, Mastercard and Discover have blocked all payments to Pornhub, after the adult site was accused of being ""infested"" with child abuse and rape-related videos.  However, sex workers are saying that the sudden decision has put their livelihoods at risk, and will not solve the problem of illegal content. Adult performer Mary Moody has started a campaign to raise awareness on the consequence for performers like her.  ""I personally stand to lose thousands each month, but I want to spotlight the many workers who will be losing the income they rely on for survival, especially during the pandemic,"" she said. A New York Times article by Nicholas Kristof highlighted the presence of illegal content on Pornhub. He called on banks and credit card companies to suspend co-operation with the site as a consequence.  The article prompted card companies to carry out their own investigations and eventually block payments to the site.   In response, Pornhub made drastic changes. It banned downloads and deleted all videos, except those uploaded by verified users.  Adult performers and producers had been campaigning for these features for years.  The ability for any user to freely download and upload content had made it possible for pirated, stolen and illegal videos to proliferate, while also making sales of original content more difficult. Now only verified creators can upload videos to Pornhub.  But the credit card suspension also makes it almost impossible for performers to receive payments or tips on the website.  ""Pornhub is the largest platform we have access to, by number of viewers and name recognition,"" said Ms Moody.  ""It comes at the top of Google searches for pretty much any industry worker."" Many performers also use other adult platforms and subscription sites, such as OnlyFans.  But Ms Moody said making the jump was more difficult than it might appear to outsiders. ""Models who focused on Pornhub are out of a lot of income, and it's not as easy as it sounds to switch platforms and immediately make money."" Swedish performer Cara Vega said: ""I've made $34 (Â£25) in Pornhub in December, which is not a lot.  ""There's not a lot you can do about it, which makes you feel really helpless. I have friends who are considering leaving the business as a whole, just because Pornhub was such a big source of income.""  The sudden and unexpected change has been an additional source of stress for performers, who have often spent months or years building up a following.  ""We didn't have time to prepare for it or to set money aside to pay rent the next month or anything like that,"" said Ms Vega.  ""Visa and MasterCard acted in a very irresponsible way, leaving people without income overnight."" Digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation has also complained about the firms exercising ""censorship powers"". It said this was similar to how they had earlier tried to cut off payments to ""countless sex workers"" and Wikileaks, among others.  ""Any website or individual can find itself running foul of Visa and Mastercard's moral sensibilities,"" it blogged in December. Some of the adult performers share this concern. ""I'm worrying that the same thing will happen to other platforms,""  says June Liu, the third-highest ranked model on Pornhub's section for independent creators. But in a recent interview with a New York Times podcast, Mastercard's chief executive insisted that the decision had nothing to do with morals and was based solely on legal concerns. And, in a statement on Twitter, Visa said: ""Given the allegations of illegal activity, Visa is suspending Pornhub's acceptance privileges pending the completion of our ongoing investigation. ""At Visa, we are vigilant in our efforts to stamp out illegal activity on our network, and we encourage our financial institution partners to regularly review their merchants' compliance of our standards on this and other platforms."" Sex workers argue that the freeze won't affect abusers and criminals who uploaded illegal content, as only certified creators could sell videos. ""Why should Visa or Mastercard decide that a person can't spend their money on something that's completely legal?"" said adult performer and sex workers' rights activist Ginger Banks.  Sex workers often feel discriminated against by financial institutions, because working in the sex industry makes it difficult to access services and incurs higher fees.  ""I genuinely hope crypto-currency makes them irrelevant,"" said Ms Banks.  Pornhub does still accept payments via Bitcoin. ""The credit card block is the result of the campaigning by religiously-motivated groups like Exodus Cry,"" claimed adult performer Valentina Nappi.  ""The real target of these groups is not to help victims or fight illegal content on the internet, but to ban all forms of adult material."" Traffickinghub, the biggest campaign against Pornhub, is led by Exodus Cry, a Christian group dedicated to abolishing all forms of sex work.  The campaign says that Pornhub is consciously complicit in abuse, trafficking and violence, by profiting from the illegal content hosted on the site. It should be therefore ""shut down"" and held accountable. There have been several reported examples of Pornhub being slow to remove illegal or contested content, as documented by this BBC investigation last year. ""Unverified users are now banned from uploading content - a policy no other platform has put in place, including Facebook, which reported 84 million instances of child sexual abuse material over the last three years,"" said Pornhub in a statement.  ""In comparison, the Internet Watch Foundation reported 118 incidents on Pornhub over the last three years."" Sex workers and adult sites argue that the issue with illegal and abusive material affects all platforms allowing users to upload content, including social media.  ""I have called the Swedish authorities five times in the last couple of months, because I've seen child porn on Reddit,"" said Ms Vega.  ""Removing the ability for people to purchase ethically-made good porn from independent creators doesn't have any positive effect.""

Why WhatsApp wants you to agree to new privacy terms," WhatsApp is forcing users to agree to sharing information with Facebook if they want to keep using the service. The company warns users in a pop-up notice that they ""need to accept these updates to continue using WhatsApp"" - or delete their accounts.  But Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, said European and UK users would not see the same data-sharing changes, although they will need to accept new terms. The exception has been welcomed by some as a victory for EU privacy regulators. The deadline in both regions to accept the change is 8 February, after which ""you'll need to accept these updates to continue using WhatsApp"", the company said in the pop-up alert to users. A section of the international privacy policy has been removed, which previously let people opt out of sharing personal information with Facebook for the first 30 days after the changes went live. Instead, the latest alert points users to its online help centre ""if you would prefer to delete your account"". The move has prompted some people online - including Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk - to call for users to switch to other more privacy-focused messaging services like Signal and Telegram. There was initial confusion over how much the enhanced sharing of data would affect EU and UK users. The ""key updates"" summary of important changes highlights integration with Facebook in the international copy - but does not do so on the European version of the same page. Later on Thursday, Facebook issued a statement saying that there would be no changes in the ""European region"" - which covers the EU, EEA, and post-Brexit UK. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, it is still the case that WhatsApp does not share European region WhatsApp user data with Facebook for the purpose of Facebook using this data to improve its products or advertisements,"" a spokesperson said. Facebook facing US legal action over competitionTech Tent: Breaking up Facebook However, the new version of the privacy policy for European users explicitly says that data can be shared with other Facebook companies to show personalised advertising and offers, make suggestions for content, and ""help"" to complete purchases, among other reasons. Facebook says it does not use WhatsApp information for those kind of purposes in Europe, because of negotiations with European data protection bodies. Some held the development up as a success for Europe's tighter privacy regulations introduced in recent years. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Dutch MEP Paul Tang tweeted: ""Facebook grants itself access to all of our WhatsApp-data unlessâ¦. you are living in the EU. ""That is why data protection matters."" Details of the kind of data collected by WhatsApp - and now shared with Facebook for non-Europeans - is buried in formal documents making up the terms and privacy policy. In an FAQ post, WhatsApp said it shares a wide range of user information with other Facebook companies, including: phone number and other information provided on registration (such as name)information about your phone, including make, model, and mobile companyyour IP address, which indicates location of your internet connectionany payments and financial transactions made over WhatsApp But it also said it may share any data covered by its privacy policy - which could include contacts, status updates, when people use WhatsApp and for how long, and unique identifying numbers for users' phones. Facebook has not responded to a request for clarification on why it has made the sudden changes.

Photographs of two families found on one 20-year-old film," The photographs of two families who do not know each other have been found on the same 20-year-old film. Lotte Johnson, 22, found the 35mm film in a drawer at her family home in Fareham, Hampshire, and thought it would hold some old family snaps.

Smart locks: Convenience comes with security doubts," For Candace Nelson, finding out about smart locks from a friend ""really was a game changer"". People like her, who live with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), often feel a need to perform routines like washing their hands, counting things or checking a door is locked. ""I have quite a few times nearly made it to work and couldn't remember if I locked the door, so I'd turn around,"" she says. On other occasions she has driven for an hour before turning back. ""My brain will not stop until I know for sure,"" explains Miss Nelson, who works for the Girl Scouts in Charleston, West Virginia. But in September she installed a door lock that she can monitor from her smartphone. ""Being able to just look at my phone and feel that sense of comfort really helps put me at ease,"" she says. Smart locks like Kwikset's Kevo began to appear in 2013. Using a Kevo, your smartphone transmits the key by bluetooth from your pocket, then you touch the lock to open it. Bluetooth uses less energy than wi-fi, but offers fewer features. Raising the stakes, Yale's August and Schlage's Encode, launched in 2018 and 2019, have wi-fi as well. Wi-fi lets you monitor and control the lock when you're away from home, and see the face of your Amazon delivery person who wants to get in.  Connecting with wi-fi also allows your lock to talk to Alexa or Siri, and turn on your lights and adjust the thermostat when you get home. The electronic equivalent of a dog fetching your slippers. Using a smartphone as a key has become especially popular for AirBnB hosts, and the rental platform has a partnership with Yale. Worldwide, the smart lock market is on track to reach $4.4bn (Â£3.2bn) in 2027, up tenfold from $420m in 2016, according to market research firm Statista. Smartphone keys are also gaining popularity in Asia. Taiwan-based Tracy Tsai, research firm Gartner's vice president for connected homes, points out that people are already happy to use smartphones for shopping so using them as a key is a small step. More Technology of Business Greener planes of the future... or just pretty plans?Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industryTech trends in 2021: Fast planes and homeworkingCreating animal food from a greenhouse gasA palm oil alternative could help save rainforests But some analysts worry about the fast growth of the market and whether locks are secure enough. As principal security researcher at Tripwire, a risk management software firm, Craig Young has tested many smart locks. He says he would not be comfortable having a smart lock on his home. Mr Young thinks that some manufacturers do not invest enough in looking for flaws in their systems.  ""I think there's a lot of times that organisations are trying to reinvent the wheel for some of the fundamental components... and they don't have the necessary expertise to do that securely."" There is the risk that the lock could be opened by a hacker, but Mr Young is also concerned about reliability.  ""Until I've seen better proven track records of reliability for the uptime of the services that are running the systems, as well as the individual components in these locks, I don't think it's a great idea to make your personal safety rely on these,"" he says. Another challenge for manufacturers has been extending battery life, currently about six months for locks using wi-fi.  ""Wi-fi is very challenging. It's kind of the holy grail of Internet of Things devices,"" says Rob Martens, chief design officer at Allegion, which makes Schlage locks. ""The biggest challenge is creating a product that doesn't drain the battery,"" agrees Jeff Pouliot from Minneapolis smart lock maker Lockly.  One solution is to let locks conserve power in a standby mode, then check in every few seconds to see if they should stay connected to the wi-fi. The locks wake up quickly enough for the user not to notice any delay, but a lot of power is saved by the intermittent wi-fi connection. It can also be tricky to install smart locks. Yale Locks has a retrofit device that fits over an existing deadbolt with a few screws.  Helpful if you're in rented accommodation, although a problem is lock types. In Asia and the US, they're pretty standard, but in the UK, houses can be very old and quirky. ""I'm a bit of a door nerd now,"" confesses Kate Clark, London-based managing director for Stockholm's ASSA ABLOY Group, which makes Yale Locks. For fast-growing parts of South East Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia, holiday homes and smart locks are popular, but the internet connections may be ropy.  One workaround is dispensing with internet connectivity altogether.  A server can use an algorithm to give you a code a lock can recognise without being connected to the network, says Cherry Lim from Singapore-based Igloohome, which makes a device using this principle. ""The lock knows this code works from 3:30 to 5:50,"" she says.  Lock makers now realise they need to design for two very different types of users, says Mr Martens.  Some want an ""active command and control experience"" using Siri or Alexa.  But others long for locks to ""do autonomously what you want them to do and be forgotten into the background, so they add value by removing complexity in your life,"" he says. If we used to think of locks as a way of keeping everyone out, wi-fi locks are instead becoming devices to lock the right people out while letting your cleaner, mum or delivery person in. They can have unexpected uses too, says Candace Nelson. A friend of hers broke up with her boyfriend, and instead of changing her locks, simply removed him from her authorised key users.

UK leading the way in use of language-learning apps," The popularity of language-learning apps has boomed around the world during the coronavirus lockdowns, and the UK has, somewhat surprisingly, led the way. For a country not renowned for its population's skill or enthusiasm at learning a foreign language, the Covid-19 pandemic appears to have seen many more Britons try their hand at becoming at least a bit bilingual. With lockdowns limiting what we can otherwise do with our leisure time, people have been downloading apps to swap their ""hellos"" for a ""buenos dÃ­as"", ""bonjour"" or ""guten tag"". Londoner Chelsey Hames started using language app Duolingo to learn some French last year. After a few months, the 33-year-old says she ""could suddenly read blocks of French text"". ""While I can't translate word for word, I can now get the idea and sentiment behind the writing. It is absolute magic."" US firm Duolingo says that its new user numbers soared in 2020, especially in the UK. It says that globally they were up 67% compared with 2019, while in the UK they shot up by 132%, almost double the worldwide average. ""The UK has really embraced language learning during the pandemic,"" says Duolingo's UK manager Colin Watkins. Prior to Covid-19 he says the biggest reason British users said they wanted to learn a language was for travelling overseas. But with global travel mostly curtailed, people were now learning because of other factors. ""Since Covid there's been a huge increase in people wanting to learn for a whole variety of reasons - whether that is for [helping with] school, brain training or culture. We have all wanted to do something positive with our time."" For the app's now 13 million UK users, Spanish remains the most popular language that people want to learn, followed by French. Other language apps have also seen big growth. London-based Busuu says that while its active global user numbers tripled last year, numbers in the UK rose more than fourfold (312%). It now has more than three million UK users. Meanwhile, Berlin-based Babbel says its UK user registrations increased by 80% in 2020, compared with a 50% rise worldwide. It now has 10 million customers globally, but did not release a figure for the UK. What Babbel did say is that its data shows that Britons are actually much better at learning a foreign language than their reputation suggests. ""When a lot of Brits say that they are not very good at language learning, that's the first thing that we don't see in our data,"" says Babbel's chief executive Arne Schepker. ""[For Britons], both learning engagement and how much you learn - how easy you find it to build a learning habit, the amount of mistakes and the amount of progress that you make through our material - is absolutely competitive in the international environment."" He adds that Spanish is now the most popular language for its UK users, overtaking French. And that the new top reason why people have signed up is an interest in language learning and other cultures, which has overtaken travel. But why are more British people now learning a new language compared with the global averages? Duolingo's Mr Watkins says there may have been a cultural change. ""The UK now sees real value in learning a language for fun, not because they have to,"" he says. ""People are learning because of culture, brain training, family, and relationships, along with school and travel. We want a positive use of our time, and to do something productive on our phones. Covid gave people the stimulus to do this."" Maria Lievano, a Spanish teacher based in the UK, thinks that Brexit may have also played a factor. ""It is possible that Brexit may have played a part in why the UK, in particular, saw so many people using these apps,"" she says. ""Particularly those who want to give themselves the opportunity to work in, or do business with, other countries now Britain has left the EU,"" she says. ""So with many people at home furloughed, or redundant, this period gave them time to evaluate their future career options, whether to look for work abroad or to improve their skill set. ""And for others, perhaps learning a foreign language is simply a way to dream of the holiday they can't go on due to the pandemic."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. While Duolingo and Busuu both offer free and paid-for premium versions, Babbel is only free for the first week. All three have put a lot of work into their software to try to make the learning process as effective as possible. But are they actually any good? How proficient can people get in another language by using them? Renowned linguist Stephen Krashen, professor emeritus of the University of Southern California, is not very complimentary. ""My analyses of their results show that they achieve the same mediocre results as traditional methods do in regular classrooms, and produce the same lack of enthusiasm from students,"" he says. ""We don't acquire language by speaking or writing, even when we get our errors corrected. Rather, the ability to speak and write fluently and accurately is the result of language acquisition via comprehensible input, such as good books, movies and interesting stories."" Busuu's co-founder Bernhard Niesner admits that ""the best way to learn a language is to be in the country, and be fully able to speak with native speakers"" but says that ""we want to replicate that with Busuu"". He adds that he believes the popularity of language-learning apps is here to stay.  ""We think that this is going to sustain because a lot of people now, for the first time, have used their mobile phone to learn something, and they understand the benefit of it,"" he says. ""It's super flexible, it's personalised, it's much cheaper maybe than traditional learning."" French learner Chelsey Hames says: ""There is something about learning and speaking more than one language that I think brings the world a little closer together."" ""And it feels good to be a part of that, particularly in our current situation.""",BBC News - Technology,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:02:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55562267
Fifa 21 and Frozen 2 top digital sales of 2020," The UK spent a record Â£9.05bn ($12bn) on home entertainment in 2020, with more than 80p in every pound going on digital formats, new figures reveal. The biggest-selling video game was the latest Fifa 21 football game, with more than two million downloads and discs sold. Disney's Frozen 2 was the most-purchased movie, while Lewis Capaldi topped the 2020 album sales chart. The Entertainment Retailers' Association (ERA) published the report. It included data supplied by the Official Charts Company and the Interactive Software Federation of Europe. However, it did not reveal the most-streamed television programmes and movies because services such as Netflix, Prime Video and BBC iPlayer do not make the data publicly available. The ERA said digital services had grown faster than ever before, with revenue reaching Â£7.8bn, up Â£1.4bn on 2019. The group's chief executive Kim Bayley described it as a ""dramatic leap"" which ""filled the gap left by shuttered cinemas, concert halls and retail stores"" while the country spent months in lockdown. ""If there was ever a year in which we needed entertainment, it was 2020,"" she said. Sales of most physical entertainment formats such as DVDs, Blu-Rays and CDs were all down, with the exception of vinyl which saw sales increase 13% to Â£110m.  Music download sales were also down by almost 20%, as consumers switched to streaming services .

What is Elon Musk's Starship?," Elon Musk is planning to soon launch the prototype of a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. The founding ethos of Elon Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. This is partly motivated by existential threats such as an asteroid collision big enough to wipe out humanity.  Settling other planets would place some of the eggs in other baskets, sparing human civilisation if one of them were to experience a cataclysm. In 2016, the entrepreneur outlined his rationale at an international conference in Mexico: ""History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event,"" he said. ""The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."" Musk has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon?Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guideStarship prototype makes big impact Realising this dream requires a vehicle that's up to the task. Starship is a rocket and spacecraft combination that could ferry more than 100 people a time to the Red Planet. The system is designed to be fully reusable, meaning the principal hardware elements are not discarded in the sea or allowed to burn up, as happens with some other launch systems, but are instead recovered from space. They can then be refurbished and flown again, reducing the cost of the whole enterprise. The rocket part of the system is called Super Heavy, while the spacecraft part is called Starship. The combined system will stand 120m (394ft) -tall and is also referred to as Starship. Let's take the spacecraft first. With its nosecone and landing fins, the stainless-steel vehicle resembles the rocket-ships from the golden age of science fiction.  The 50m (160ft) -long craft, also known as the upper stage, has a huge payload compartment near the front that will be able to haul large cargo or people to destinations in deep space. Towards the middle of the craft are the propellant tanks. These feed liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (O2) to six Raptor engines at the rear of the vehicle. Methane is the fuel and oxygen acts as an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. The combination is dubbed methalox.  The choice of fuel is unusual for rocket engines, but methane can generate plenty of thrust. It's also a prudent choice in light of Musk's designs on Mars. The SpaceX founder says that CH4 could be synthesised from Martian subsurface water and from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using a chemical process known as the Sabatier reaction. SpaceX has spent more than a decade developing the highly efficient Raptor engine. The combustion takes place in stages, and the engine's design cuts the amount of propellant that's wasted. Re-fuelling Starship for the return trip to Earth using Martian resources would confer a level of self-sufficiency, making journeys both more feasible and cost-effective. Now, let's turn to the rocket. Measuring 70m (230ft) -long, Super Heavy will be filled with 3,400 tonnes (6.8 million lbs) of cryogenic (chilled) methalox. It will be powered by around 28 Raptor engines (this specification has changed several times), providing some 16 million lbs (72 Meganewtons) of maximum thrust. It should be able to lift at least 100 tonnes of payload, and possibly as much as 150 tonnes, to low-Earth orbit. This will make Super Heavy more powerful than the immense Saturn V launcher used for the Apollo Moon missions in the 1960s and 70s. As it ascends from the launch pad, the combined Starship system will begin to pitch over towards the intended orbit.  When the upper stage separates in space, Super Heavy flips over while falling back towards Earth.  As it descends, Super Heavy will deploy steel structures called ""grid fins"", shaped a bit like potato waffles, from the sides of the booster. These will help steer the rocket stage back towards its launch pad so it can be flown again. Previously, SpaceX had wanted to ignite Super Heavy's Raptor engines to guide it down to a precision landing on six steel legs. SpaceX does something similar with the first stages of its Falcon 9 rockets, landing them safely on landing pads and drone ships after a launch. But Mr Musk recently tweeted to say that this thinking had changed. SpaceX now plans to catch the falling booster using an arm on the launch tower.  This is the structure that provides engineers and crew members with access to the spacecraft and rocket while they are sitting on the pad before launch. How exactly this ""catch mechanism"" will work, however, remains to be seen.  Meanwhile, the Starship upper stage could be inserted into a ""parking orbit"" after separation, allowing it to be re-fuelled. ""If you just fly [Starship] to orbit and don't do any refilling, it's pretty good â you'll get 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, and have no fuel to go anywhere else,"" Musk explained during a conference keynote speech in 2017. ""If you send up tankers and re-fill in orbit, you could re-fill the tanks up all the way to the top, and get 150 tonnes [of payload] all the way to Mars."" To re-fuel, the spacecraft would dock, or mate, with another Starship - already circling the Earth - that acts solely as a propellant depot. ""The two ships would actually mate at the rear section. They would use the same mating interface that they use to connect to the booster on lift-off,"" Musk said in 2017. ""To transfer propellant it becomes very simple: You use control thrusters to accelerate in the direction that you want to empty."" For long-haul trips to Mars and back - which could take up to nine months each way - Musk is looking to install around 40 cabins in the payload area near the front of the upper stage. ""You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,"" Musk said. The payload bay would also host common areas, storage space, a galley and a shelter where people could gather to shield from solar storms, where the Sun belches out harmful charged particles into space. Starship might also play a role in Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In 2020, SpaceX was awarded $135m by Nasa to advance the design of Starship so it could be used as a crewed lunar lander.  The version tailored for Artemis flights would not possess the heat shield or flaps that are necessary for a return journey to Earth. Instead, the Starship Human Landing System would remain in space after its initial launch from Earth, to be used for multiple trips between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface. The uncrewed, or cargo, version of Starship features a payload bay that opens up like the mouth of a crocodile. This would allow it to be used for launching satellites. SpaceX says the huge payload capacity opens up possibilities for new types of robotic science mission, including telescopes larger than the James Webb observatory - the forthcoming successor to Hubble. The system could even be used for high-speed journeys between different destinations on Earth. Musk says that Starship could eventually carry people to destinations in the ""greater Solar System"", including gas giants such as Jupiter. But this remains a long-term objective. In order to bring other spacecraft back to Earth, engineers have relied on parachutes, or designed the vehicle so that it can land on a runway. But the Starship upper stage takes a different approach. When it is ready to land, the ship initially re-enters the atmosphere at a 60-degree angle and then ""belly-flops"" to the ground in the horizontal position. This mode of return relies entirely on the atmosphere to slow the vehicle's descent. The downside is that, in this configuration, Starship is inherently unstable. The vehicle therefore uses four steel landing flaps, positioned near the front and rear of the vehicle, to control its descent. This is much like a skydiver uses their arms and legs to control a free-fall. ""It's quite different from anything elseâ¦ we're doing a controlled fall,"" Elon Musk said during a Starship update in 2019.  ""You're trying to create drag rather than lift - it's really the opposite of an aircraft."" As Starship approaches the ground, it should be slow enough to execute an engine burn that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. It then uses the Raptors as retro-rockets to guide the vehicle down to a safe landing. Musk says this general approach could be used to bring Starship down safely on any planetary surface in the Solar System - Mars included. In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the Starship upper stage at its Boca Chica facility in Texas. The company started off with a 39m-tall ""test article"" called Starhopper, which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower. Since flying this vehicle to 150m above ground, SpaceX has been developing increasingly complex Starship prototypes. In December 2020, SpaceX launched a test article named SN8 (Starship number 8) - the first to feature a nosecone and flaps. After reaching an altitude of 12.5km, SN8 belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of Starship's return from space. It was almost a textbook flight, but the vehicle approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. SpaceX has already moved prototype SN9 to the launch pad, and, this time, they're aiming to stick the landing. In October 2020, Elon Musk said SpaceX was aiming to launch Starship on an uncrewed flight to Mars in 2024. Some observers note that Mr Musk's timelines are sometimes optimistic. But he has also developed a reputation for eventually achieving his goals, no matter how ambitious.

Greener planes of the future... or just pretty plans?," At an undisclosed location Airbus has spent months testing a radical looking plane. At 10ft (3m) wide, it is only small, but it could be the start of something very big in the aerospace industry. It looks like a flying wedge - known in the trade as a blended-wing design. Airbus calls the remote-controlled aircraft Maveric and is keen to emphasise that, at the moment, it is only exploring how the configuration works. But it says the design has ""great potential"". One day it could be scaled up to the size of a regular passenger jet. In traditional aircraft the fuselage is basically dead weight and needs big wings to keep it in the sky. Under a blended-wing design, the whole airframe provides lift, so it can be lighter and smaller than current designs, but can potentially carry the same payload. Maveric is one of several initiatives from Airbus, and there are many by other aerospace firms, to meet an industry target to halve emissions from air travel by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. ""There is a really big challenge there. And there is a big expectation from society which we think it is our duty to find answers to,"" says Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, the chief executive of Airbus UpNext, which evaluates new technologies for the European aerospace giant. ""We believe that we have to go into a reallyâ¦ breakthrough technology,"" she says. An equally radical idea is being explored at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Researchers there are working on a design known as the ""Flying-V"". It is a new concept for a long-haul aircraft, which they claim would be up to 20% more efficient than a state-of-the-art modern plane such as the Airbus A350. Like Maveric, it abandons the idea of a conventional fuselage. But in this case the shape is more like an arrowhead, with two wings stretching out behind the cockpit in a V. Passengers and cargo would be carried within the wings themselves. The designers think it would be cheaper to build than the blended wing because the two arms of the V could be ""plugged"" into the rest of the fuselage. So the aircraft could be built in parts, rather than all at once. ""We think we can keep the manufacturing costs relatively low, compared to concepts that would have more unique components,"" says Roelof Vos, the project lead for the Flying-V and an assistant professor at Delft University of Technology. The design was originally the brainchild of a graduate student, and formed part of his thesis. It is being developed with support from the Dutch airline KLM and Airbus - and in July a scale model took to the skies for the first time, from an airbase in Germany. The flight of the test aircraft - a battery-powered drone with a 9ft wingspan - was deemed a success. Researchers said the machine performed well, although it did suffer from a kind of aerodynamic wobbling, known as ""Dutch roll"". This made it difficult to keep the wings level, and resulted in what they described as ""a somewhat rough landing"" that damaged the front landing gear. Data from those tests is currently being analysed and incorporated into a flight test simulator. Airlines have seen their sales slump due to the pandemic, but despite that KLM says it will continue to support research into the Flying-V. The attractions of more efficient aircraft are obvious, for an industry where cost control is vital to profitability, and which is under intense pressure to reduce its environmental impact. But with the basic layout of commercial aircraft having gone unchanged for decades, there are other practical issues to consider - some of which avionics expert Steve Wright of the University of the West of England describes as ""showstoppers"". More Technology of Business Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industryTech trends in 2021: Fast planes and homeworkingCreating animal food from a greenhouse gasA palm oil alternative could help save rainforestsSo you want a career in computer games tournaments? Among them are how passengers board or leave the aircraft. In the case of the blended wing, for example, the wide central section could make the boarding process take longer, while passengers in the middle would be a long way from the exits in an emergency. There's also the question of passenger comfort. Those sitting close to the side of the aircraft - and effectively close to the edge of the ""wing"" - would experience much greater movement when the aircraft is banking, while take-off and landing would have to be at steeper angles than normal. Building a new type of aircraft would also present a challenge to the aerospace industry. Airbus, for example, makes sections and components of existing aircraft all over Europe, before bringing them for final assembly in Hamburg and Toulouse. It is a tried and tested supply chain, using the specific expertise present in each region. ""That well-oiled manufacturing machine... it would certainly be strained and would have to be redesigned,"" says Mr Wright. Airbus insists that issues such as these are already under consideration and would be considered as part of the design process - but there's little doubt a design such as the blended wing or Flying-V would represent a major gamble for a manufacturer. Its rival Boeing has spent years studying a concept that is less obviously radical, but still a clear departure from what we have now: the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Aircraft equipped with the wing would look relatively conventional, with a central fuselage. But the wing itself would be much longer and thinner, and would be braced by a support, or truss, angled up from beneath the fuselage. The wing would fold to make accessing conventional airport gates easier. Boeing says the new design would need 9% less fuel than a conventional design. But current research is not only focused on aerodynamics. There's also the question of how future aircraft are powered. For short-range flights, with a limited number of passengers, battery power might be viable. Projects such as the Eviation Alice - shown off at the 2019 Paris Airshow - are based on proving that concept. For longer distances, batteries are currently impractical, because they are simply too heavy and do not contain enough energy to compensate for that weight. The industry has explored other options, such as hybridisation - in which part of the thrust needed to fly is provided by electric power. One major research project was Airbus's E-Fan X, a partnership between Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. It involved fitting a single 2MW (2,700hp) electric motor, powered by an on-board generator, to a four-engined BAe 146 test plane. But the experiment was cancelled last year - before the system could be tested in flight - as the effects of the Covid outbreak led Airbus to review its priorities. Those priorities now include research into hydrogen propulsion. Airbus has pledged to build the world's first zero-emission aircraft by 2035. Its plans rely on creating hybrid systems, using hydrogen-burning gas turbine engines as well as hydrogen fuel cells to generate electric power. In September, Airbus unveiled three concept hydrogen-powered designs. Hydrogen fuel could even be combined with a radical design - one of the concepts included the blended wing. But there is a significant problem here. Most of our hydrogen supplies today are derived from methane - a fossil fuel - which is mixed with steam at high pressures. It is an energy-intensive process that creates significant quantities of carbon dioxide. In order to be truly zero emission, aircraft would need to be powered by hydrogen produced in a much more environmentally friendly way - and large quantities would be needed. But according to Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft, society itself will eventually provide the solution.

Home-schooling: How to help your child’s online learning," With schools once again closing their doors to most pupils, parents, many juggling work and childcare, are having to step in to fill the gap. If your child's school already puts work online, via Google Classroom, for example, this will probably continue.  But these sort of tools tend to be used more by secondary schools than primaries.  So older pupils are more likely to be in the routine of checking their school's chosen platform and completing work. And they are more likely to have their own laptops. Some schools are asking older children to follow their existing timetables, with some active lessons, involving Google Hangouts and virtual classrooms, and some passive ones, in which children work independently. And depending on the individual school, there will probably be a system to allow children to submit work and have it marked. ParentKind has published a list of free online resources, as has Oak National Academy, which is collated by teachers. Many schools are also providing lists of resources on a range of topics, to help parents navigate this difficult time, such as: BrainPop - animated videos on topics in maths, science and English Tynker - coding lessons Creative Bug - craft lessons, from knitting to jewellery-making, drawing and origami YouTube's Free School - videos on subjects as diverse as the US constitution, coral reefs and the solar system Many schools already pay for online resources, so it is worth checking which ones you can access, as these will follow the curriculum.  About half of UK schools use sites such as MathsWatch, for example, which caters for children from Year 4 up to A-level. BBC Bitesize has lots of content divided into subject and age categories, with much new material added since March. The BBC will also show curriculum content on TV every weekday from Monday, 11 January:  primary-school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, from 09:00 to 12:00 on CBBCat least two hours of programming to support the GCSE curriculum on BBC Two The government, meanwhile, unlike during the first national lockdown, will expect schools to deliver their own online learning. If parents have any concerns about their child's education, the government says they should raise it with a teacher in the first instance. If the matter is still not resolved, parents can contact the schools watchdog, Ofsted. Little and often is the advice from MathsWatch co-founder Ken Smith, a teacher for 34 years.  ""Even an hour's lesson at school is broken down by teachers,"" he says. ""And parents need to do the same.  ""It is much better to do a little bit every day.""  Online schooling: calls to cut data fees during lockdownCovid 19: School closures and mental health tipsSchools closed with 'the heaviest of hearts'Remote learning: how do you feel about more studying at home? But like the school day, it is important to establish a routine, says Sarah Dove, a teacher who works online with children who cannot attend school. ""The key is finding out what works for you as a family but have a delineation between home life and school,"" she says. ""Don't spend all day in pyjamas.  ""Come together for a mindfulness session rather than an assembly and do topic-based work too."" Even at school, children are not working from 09:00 to 15:00, Ms Wespieser says. So expecting them ""to sit at the table with paper and pen"" all day is unrealistic. But it is important parents think about themselves as well. ""One of the biggest challenges parents have reported to us is balancing their own work with school work,"" she says.  ""And employers may be a bit less sympathetic this time. ""Parents need to look after their own wellbeing and take the time to find what works for you.  ""And schools should be giving a lot more advice."" In the last lockdown, there were concerns about a digital divide between affluent families with access to laptops and those who did not have devices and may have struggled to get their children online at all. Add to that the cost of broadband and the fact some parts of the country still don't have access to decent internet speeds, and home-schooling could be a nightmare for many families. The government delivered more than 560,000 devices to schools and councils in England between March and December and has promised another 100,000 by the end of this week. Unions have asked for this effort to be stepped up ""urgently"", while others have called for data costs on educational apps and websites to be deducted from broadband charges. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the government is working with mobile phone operators to provide free data for key educational sites, as well as delivering 4G routers to families who need internet access. The Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection, while some internet providers are also helping out.

Elon Musk's six secrets to business success," Elon Musk has just become the richest person in the world, overtaking Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.  The Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur's net worth has crossed $185bn (Â£136bn) after an increase in the share price of the electric car company. So, what is the secret of his success? A few years back I spent almost an hour discussing exactly this with him. To mark his new milestone we decided to dust the interview off and share it with you. So here is Elon Musk's guide to success in business.  This is absolutely central to Elon Musk's attitude to business.   When I interviewed him in 2014 he said he didn't know how rich he was.   ""It's not as if there is a pile of cash somewhere,"" he said. ""It's really just that I have a certain number of votes in Tesla, and SpaceX, and SolarCity, and the marketplace has value on those votes.""   He doesn't have anything against the pursuit of wealth ""if it's done in sort of an ethical and good manner"", but said it just isn't what drives him.  The approach certainly seems to be working.   The real-life inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark of Iron Man fame was worth perhaps $10bn when we spoke in 2014.  His electric car company, Tesla, has performed particularly well. Shares have surged over the past year to take its value to more than $700bn. For that you could buy Ford, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, and still have enough left over to buy Ferrari. But Musk, who turns 50 this year, doesn't expect to die rich. He said he thinks most of his money will be spent building a base on Mars, and wouldn't be surprised if the project consumed his entire fortune. In fact, like Bill Gates, he would probably regard ending his life with billions in the bank as a mark of failure because he hadn't put that money to good use. That Mars base is a clue to what Elon Musk believes is the key to success.   ""You want things in the future to be better,"" he told me. ""You want these new exciting things that make life better."" Take SpaceX. He told me he set the company up because he was frustrated the US space programme wasn't more ambitious.   ""I kept expecting us to advance beyond Earth, and to put a person on Mars, and have a base on the moon, and have, you know, very frequent flights to orbit,"" he said. When that didn't happen, he came up with the idea for the ""Mars Oasis Mission"", which aimed to send a small greenhouse to the red planet. The idea was to get people excited about space again, and persuade the US government to increase Nasa's budget. It was while he was trying to get that off the ground he realised the problem wasn't ""a lack of will, but rather a lack of way"" - space technology was far more expensive than it needed to be. Et voila! The world's cheapest rocket-launching business was born. And here's the important thing, its genesis wasn't about making money, but landing a person on Mars.   Musk told me he regards himself as an engineer rather than an investor, and says what gets him up in the morning is the desire to solve technical problems.   It is that, rather than dollars in the bank, that is his yardstick of progress. He knows every hurdle his businesses overcome helps everyone else who's trying to solve the same problem - and it does it forever. That's why, shortly before we met, the entrepreneur had announced he was going to open up all Tesla's patents to speed up the development of electric vehicles worldwide.   How Elon Musk plans to revolutionise battery technologyElon Musk's vision for autonomous vehicles One of the really striking things about Elon Musk's businesses is how audacious they are.   He wants to revolutionise the car industry, colonise Mars, build super-fast trains in vacuum tunnels, integrate AI into human brains and upend the solar power and battery industries.   There's a common thread here. All of his projects are the kind of futuristic fantasies you'd find in a kid's magazine in the early 1980s.   Put it like this, his tunnelling business is called The Boring Company. Musk makes no secret of the fact he was inspired by the books and movies he consumed as a kid in South Africa. Which brings us to Musk's third business tip - don't hold back. He believes low ambition is baked into most companies' incentive structures. Too many companies are ""incrementalist"", he said. ""If you're the CEO of a big company and you aim for something that's a modest improvement, and it takes longer than expected, and doesn't work out quite as well, then nobody's gonna blame you,"" he told me. You can say it wasn't my fault, it was the suppliers.  If you are bold, and go for a really breakthrough improvement, and it doesn't work, you're definitely going to get fired, he argues. He says this is why most companies focus on making small improvements to their existing products rather than daring to imagine completely new ones.   So, his advice is to make sure you are working on what he calls ""stuff that's going to matter"".   Two things stand out in Musk's personal hierarchy of stuff that matters. First, he wants to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels.   Here's what the entrepreneur had to say about that: ""We're drawing upon deep gas fields and deep oil fields that haven't seen the light of day since the Cambrian era. If the last time something saw light was when the most complex organism was a sponge, you really have to question whether that is a wise move."" Second, he wants to ensure the long-term survival of humanity by colonising Mars and ""making life multiplanetary"". Like I say, think big. This one is obvious. You've got to have skin in the game to do well, but Elon Musk has taken more risks than most. By 2002 he had sold off his holdings in his first two ventures, an internet city guide called Zip2 and the online payment company PayPal. He had just entered his 30s and had almost $200m in the bank.  He says his plan was to put half his fortune into the businesses and keep the other half.  Things didn't work out like that. When I met him, he was just emerging from the darkest period of his business life.  His new companies faced all sorts of teething troubles. SpaceX's first three launches had failed, and Tesla had all manner of production problems, and supply chain, and design issues.   Then the financial crisis struck. Musk said he faced a stark choice. ""I could either keep the money, then the companies are definitely going to die, or invest what I have left and maybe there is a chance."" He kept pouring in money. At one point he was so in debt he had to borrow money from friends just to pay his living expenses, he told me.   So, did the prospect of bankruptcy frighten him?   He says it didn't: ""My kids might have to go to a sort of government school. I mean big deal, I went to a government school."" What really shocked him - and it was clear in 2014 he was still very upset by it - was the delight many pundits and commentators took in his travails.   ""The liberal schadenfreude was really quite astonishing,"" said Musk. ""There were multiple blog sites maintaining a Tesla death watch."" I suggested people may have wanted him to fail because there's a kind of arrogance about his ambition. He rejected that. ""I think it would be arrogant if we said we were definitely going to do it, as opposed to we're aspiring to do it, and we're going to give it our best shot."" This brings us to Musk's next lesson in business success - don't listen to the critics. He told me he didn't believe SpaceX or Tesla would ever make money when he set them up - and the truth is nor did anyone else. But he ignored the doomsters and went ahead anyway.  Why? Remember, this is a man who judges success on the basis of the important problems he's solved, not how much money he has made. Think how liberating that is. He isn't worried about looking stupid because his big financial bet hasn't paid off, what he cares about is pursuing important ideas.  It makes decision making much simpler because he can stay focused on what he believes really matters.  And the market seems to like what he's doing.   In October, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley valued SpaceX at $100bn.   The company has transformed the economics of space flight, but what will make Musk most proud will be how his company has reinvigorated the US space programme.  Last year his Crew Dragon rockets launched six astronauts to the International Space Station, the first such missions from US soil since the space shuttles were retired in 2011. Follow this guide and, with a bit of luck, you'll become impossibly rich and famous too. Then you can start to come out of your shell. Elon Musk is famously a workaholic - he boasts of working 120-hour weeks to keep production of the Tesla Model 3 on track - but since we met he seems to have been enjoying himself. He has stoked controversy with defamation lawsuits, on-air dope smoking and wild outbursts on social media.   In 2018 he ran into trouble with the US financial regulator when he tweeted that he was planning to take Tesla private, and when the Covid-19 pandemic forced Tesla to shut down production at its San Francisco Bay Area factory, he became a vocal opponent of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.   He called panic over the virus ""dumb"" on Twitter, and described stay-at-home orders as ""forcible imprisonment"", saying they were ""fascist"" and a breach of constitutional rights.   In the summer he announced plans to sell off his physical possessions saying they ""weigh you down"".   Days later he took to Twitter to tell the world his newborn son would be called X Ã A-12 Musk. Yet his unpredictable behaviour doesn't seem to have affected his businesses, and the entrepreneur remains as ambitious as ever. In September, Musk claimed Tesla would have a ""compelling"" $25,000 car within three years, and said soon all the company's new cars would be completely self-driving. And his year ended with a real bang in December, when SpaceX tested its Starship launch vehicle, which it hopes will take the first humans to Mars.   The giant rocket exploded when it crash landed six minutes after lift-off.   Elon Musk hailed the test as an ""awesome"" success.

Vikkstar on his plans for growing Call of Duty esports," With nearly seven million YouTube subscribers, Vikkstar knows a thing or two about popularity. The content creator, real name Vikram Singh Barn, has joined Call of Duty esports team London Royal Ravens as a co-owner and says he wants to help grow the professional league.  The 25-year-old tells BBC Sounds gaming podcast Press X To Continue that he wants to help ""bridge the gap"" between content creators, esports and the audience.  ""It's helping them build what they're doing, because esports is huge. But often in the past, there hasn't been an overlap with the other things."" A member of YouTube collective Sidemen alongside other British vloggers such as KSI and Behzinga, Vik has been creating content for over 10 years. Listen to the full interview on Press X To Continue on BBC Sounds Vik's always had an interest in Call of Duty and the competitive scene, which helps explain joining the Ravens.  His battle royale streams and Warzone tournaments were popular enough to get the attention of the Call of Duty League. It led to the league sponsoring Vik to run co-streams of league matches, where he found himself commentating and hosting watch parties. He says the collaboration with the Ravens will see him create content, build brand recognition, streamer followings ""and hopefully watch the Ravens do amazingly well"".  Vik's aim is to ""build the footprint"" of competitive Call of Duty, and he feels the people who play in the league are the ""biggest thing to help grow the esport"". Having players push out their personalities and live streaming is ""more important than ever"", he explains. ""I think the icing on the cake is when they're entertaining to watch. You feel like you can get to know that person, and have a reason to root for them.""  ""The storylines going on behind the scenes, if there's a bit of drama is not always a bad thing. Rivalries are great,"" he adds. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Vik believes behind the scenes documentaries on the NFL and Formula 1 are templates for how to help popularise the esport.  ""A similar thing in the league would be amazing to see, where people are starting to understand the players more and their incentives, motivations and rivalries.""   ""I'm excited to be part of that and help bring that to the forefront."" Vik's been telling the Press X To Continue podcast his ""three core tips"" on how he wants to help streamers build an audience. ""Firstly, you have to be consistent with it and give it time. I think I went seven years straight of uploading a new video every single day."" ""It was a reliable place where people can get a new video every day. And I think that consistency is an important thing."" The Manchester twins playing Call of Duty for millionsYouTube to show Overwatch and Call of Duty leaguesBehzinga: How I overcame drinking and depression For his second tip, it's all about fun.  ""You have to find something that either you enjoy or a way of putting a spin on something that makes sure you enjoy it.""  The ""only way"" to be consistent is by doing something you like.  And make sure you're being unique.  ""Either do something that no one else is doing or take something that someone else is doing and find a niche or a unique spin."" For Vik, that was using tomahawks and throwing axes in his Call of Duty videos.  ""I would win games with my friends using the throwing axes only. And people really enjoyed that because it was something they couldn't see anywhere else.""  With 2021 starting off with lockdown announcements and many people finding it difficult, Vik belives gaming can be ""a silver lining in the clouds. ""Anyone who's involved in the gaming space has been preaching for the longest time that it's such a great way to spend your time."" It helps you develop as a person, he adds: ""And skills in terms of managing social media, economies in video games and creating connections with other people."" Being online means ""you can invent yourself as how you want to be"".  ""You can meet like-minded people, you're not limited by the people that you bump into in the real-world, you can connect with people from across the world.""

Danny Boyle to direct Sex Pistols TV series," Trainspotting director Danny Boyle is to make a six-part TV series about 1970s punk icons the Sex Pistols. Based on guitarist Steve Jones's memoir, it will star Anson Boon (from 1917) as John Lydon and Louis Partridge (Enola Holmes) as Sid Vicious.  Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams will also play Pamela Rooke, aka Jordan, who was one of the people credited with creating the punk look. Filming is due to start in March for US TV network FX. No UK broadcaster has been announced yet - but the company has a content partnership deal with the BBC, which has screened FX series like The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, Atlanta and Feud: Bette and Joan.  The Sex Pistols electrified British music and, depending on who you believed, threatened the very fabric of society at the tail end of the 1970s.  They may only have survived for two years, but their angry, nihilistic singles and violent performances changed the idea of what rock and roll could be.  Originally formed in 1972 by Jones and drummer Paul Cook, they were galvanized by the addition of John Lydon - aka Johnny Rotten - whose abrasive vocals and anti-establishment lyrics defined the band and, to a large extent, the British punk movement. They only released one album, but the sheer sonic force of songs like Anarchy In The UK, God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant became symbols of Britain's social and political turmoil, as youth unemployment soared, with young people particularly affected. Not that everyone was impressed by the Sex Pistols' curious combination of anger and apathy.  Their singles were blacklisted on the British charts and a record store manager was arrested and charged with obscenity for displaying their album cover. Facing bans across the UK, the group had to tour undercover as S.P.O.T.S. - ""Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly"". Always on the verge of chaos, they finally split up on a US tour in 1978. ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" a tired and disillusioned Johnny Rotten asked the audience at their final show - but their legacy was ensured. ""Imagine breaking into the world of The Crown and Downton Abbey with your mates and screaming your songs and your fury at all they represent,"" said Boyle, announcing his new project.  ""This is the moment that British society and culture changed forever. It is the detonation point for British street culture... where ordinary young people had the stage and vented their fury and their fashionâ¦and everyone had to watch and listen"". The series is based on Steve Jones's memoir, Lonely Boy: Tales From A Sex Pistol; which doesn't just focus on his time with the band. It begins in West London, where the young musician suffered maternal neglect and sexual abuse by a step-father, and quickly fell into crime - including an attempt to climb the chimneys of Battersea Power Station, and stealing amps from a David Bowie gig. After becoming entranced by the glam rock scene, he is taken under the wings of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who helped form, style and promote the Sex Pistols. The book demystifies the band behind the myth - showing how they struggled with the criticisms lobbed their way and the pressure of living up to their image, including the moment Jones was goaded into swearing live on primetime TV. Later chapters deal with his battles with addiction, and his recent reinvention as a tee-total ""semi-retired sexual deviant who doesn't really act out so much any more"". British-born, Australian-raised actor Toby Wallace will play Jones, following eye-catching roles in the coming-of-age drama Babyteeth and Netflix drama The Society, where he played evil teen Campbell Elliot. Anson Boon, last seen in the Kate Winslet tear-jerker Blackbird takes on the spittle-flecked role of Johnny Rotten; while out-of-control bassist Sid Vicious will be played by Louis Partridge. Sydney Chandler - daughter of film star Kyle - will become Pretenders star Chrissie Hynde, who had an affair with Jones at the height of the Sex Pistols' fame. The Witcher's Emma Appleton is cast as Nancy Spungen, the American girlfriend of Sid Vicious, who died in mysterious circumstances in October 1978. And Game Of Thrones star Maisie Williams plays ""the face of punk"", the iconoclastic model and actress Pamela Rooke, whose signature style - ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up - defined the scene. The Sex Pistols project isn't the only musical series in the pipeline. Inspired by the success of Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, the film and TV industry is snapping up the rights to all sorts of musicians' life stories, including: Respect - anAretha Franklin biopic starring Jennifer Hudson, who was hand-picked for the role by the Queen Of Soul herself.Elvis- Baz Luhrman's film sees Austin Butler filling Presley's blue suede shoes and Tom Hanks as the star's combative manager, Colonel Tom Parker.Faithfull - The inside story of Marianne Faithfull's much-publicised relationship with Mick Jagger, with Lucy Boynton in the title role.Untitled Madonna film - scripted and directed by Madonna herself, with the star promising it would depict her ""struggle as an artist trying to survive in a man's world"".The United States vs Billie Holliday - which explores how the blues singer was targeted by the FBI over political messages in her music.Teddy Pendergrass - Fast & Furious actor Tyrese Gibson will star as the 70s R&B singer, whose career was tragically cut short by a car accident.Bob Marley - The star's son Ziggy is producing a film about the reggae legend's life for Paramount pictures.The Power Of Love - ValÃ©rie Lemercier directs and stars in this French-language film inspired by the life and career of Celine Dion.

Netflix apologises for Sabrina 'Bloody Sunday' tweet," Netflix has apologised and removed a promotional tweet for Chilling Adventures of Sabrina which referenced ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"". The caption accompanied several images of cast members including star Kiernan Shipka splattered in fake blood. But many fans replied to the tweet pointing out that offence could be taken due to the the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Northern Ireland. Netflix later said ""we are very sorry for the hurt and distress it caused"". In a statement the streaming service added: ""Our tweet was unacceptable and has since been removed."" What was Bloody Sunday?Telling the story of Bloody SundayHow Sabrina was rebooted for Generation Z The caption referred to the day 13 people were killed and 15 people wounded after members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside - a predominantly Catholic part of Londonderry - on Sunday 30 January 1972. The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Sunday Bloody Sunday is also the name of a 1983 song by Irish rock band U2, which was written about the Troubles and taken from their third album War. After the tweet was published on the Sabrina Twitter account, several users encouraged Netflix to research the history of Bloody Sunday and remove the post. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina examines the origin and adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch in a dark and supernatural coming-of-age drama. The show's fourth and final series launched on Netflix at the end of last year. The original Sabrina the Teenage Witch starred Melissa Joan Hart and aired from 1996 to 2003. The story of Bloody Sunday has been told, and retold, many times and in many ways since 30 January 1972. Singers, songwriters, playwrights, poets, novelists, artists and filmmakers have all created their own interpretations of what happened that day, making ""Bloody Sunday"" an instantly recognisable phrase. In the 1980's, U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" made the Bogside familiar to a worldwide audience - and linked the 13 deaths to a global call for peace. For artists from John Lennon and Paul McCartney to Christy Moore and the Wolfe Tones, Bloody Sunday was the catalyst for anti-Troubles songs, while playwright Brian Friel modified his 1972 play 'Freedom of the City' - set in Derry's Guildhall - to include references to Bloody Sunday. More recently, two 2002 films - Paul Greengrass's ""Bloody Sunday"" starring James Nesbitt, and ""Sunday"", written by Jimmy McGovern - brought the events of 30 January 1972 to cinema and TV.

Table for three: Sex and the City to return without Samantha," A Sex and the City revival is heading to the small screen, more than 20 years after the hit series made its debut. The original HBO show followed the lives of four New York women negotiating work and relationships in the late 90s and early 2000s.  But only three of the fab four are returning for the new TV series - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Kim Cattrall, who played the popular character Samantha, will not feature. The US network did not say why Cattrall wasn't cast in the revival, titled And Just Like That - a nod to one of the show's original catchphrases. However, Cattrall has had a strained relationship with the show in recent years, and in particular with her former co-star Parker. The new series will consist of 10 half-hour episodes. Production will begin in late spring. The trailer for the HBO Max show gives nothing away; It features numerous shots of New York, but none of the characters is seen on screen.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter ""I grew up with these characters, and I can't wait to see how their story has evolved in this new chapter, with the honesty, poignancy, humour and the beloved city that has always defined them,"" Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, said in a statement. The original Sex and the City series, created by Darren Star, was based on Candace Bushnell's 1997 book of the same name. It premiered on HBO in 1998 and ran for six seasons until 2004. The show inspired two films, Sex and the City in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. A prequel series titled The Carrie Diaries, starring Anna Sophia Robb, aired on The CW in 2013/14.  Star also created Netflix show Emily in Paris, and many have drawn inevitable comparisons between that show and SATC. When it first burst on to our TV screens, Sex and the City was seen as revolutionary - four women talking openly about their love and sex lives, not to mention the sex scenes themselves. Cosmopolitans and rabbit vibrators were trending before trending was a thing. While it was praised by many for its liberating female-led content, it also attracted criticism from some quarters who felt Carrie's ongoing pursuit of Mr Big (Christopher Noth) was not exactly an advert for female independence. It was also accused of trivialising issues such as sexual harassment and for its lack of diversity, a criticism levelled at many older shows including Friends. Our 20-year affair with Sex and the CityKim Cattrall suggests SATC replacementsSex and the City reaches climax Fashion was a hugely influential part of the series - the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the opening credits, teamed with a fur coat and heels, was described as ""an ensemble rich in cultural resonance"". And Manolo Blahnik could never have dreamed of attracting so much publicity for his designer footwear. It was a ratings smash, with the hotly anticipated finale in 2004 drawing an audience of 10.6 million viewers in the US. In the UK, the final episode was watched by 4.1m on Channel 4. The series was predictably most popular in the 18-34 age group. Many SATC fans will be disappointed that larger-than-life favourite Samantha Jones - played by Kim Cattrall - will not be returning for the sequel series. Samantha was Sex and the City's most outlandish character and arguably, the star of the show. While Miranda was juggling a career and motherhood, Charlotte was focused on marriage and motherhood and Carrie poured her neuroses into her New York Star column, Samantha was the character perhaps harder to relate to but someone we all wanted to be (at least a little). She was fiercely independent and while caring for her friends, she always put her own needs before men. But news Cattrall won't reprise the role in And Just Like That comes as no surprise after years of feud rumours which were later confirmed by the British-born Canadian actress. In 2017, Cattrall told Piers Morgan she had ""never been friends"" with her co-stars. She said there was a ""toxic relationship"" and ruled out appearing in a third Sex and the City movie, denying that her decision was down to pay or ""diva"" demands. Cattrall commented that former co-star Parker ""could have been nicer"" about the situation. A different actress could play Samantha in the future, she suggested. ""I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it,"" she said. ""Maybe they could make it an African-American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones, or bring in another character."" She later criticised Parker for being ""cruel"" after she sent condolences following the death of Cattrall's brother. In an interview with People magazine shortly afterwards, SJP acknowledged Cattrall ""said things that were really hurtful about me"". Parker said: ""So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded."" On Monday, Parker replied on Instagram to someone posting that SJP ""didn't tag Samantha Jones"" into her post announcing the new series. ""I don't dislike her. I've never said that. Never would.

Sir Simon Rattle will leave the LSO for Munich," Sir Simon Rattle, one of the world's most renowned conductors, is leaving the London Symphony Orchestra to take up a new post in Germany. Sir Simon, who turns 66 next week, will become Chief Conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, in Munich, in 2023. He will succeed Mariss Jansons, who died in December 2019. Sir Simon had been expected to remain with the London Symphony, and his departure is considered a blow. However, he agreed to extend his contract with the orchestra for an extra year, and will take up a lifetime role as Conductor Emeritus from 2023 onwards, the first such appointment to this role since AndrÃ© Previn.    Sir Simon has strong links to Germany; and was previously chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic for 16 years.  He currently lives in Berlin with his third wife, the Czech-born singer Magdalena Kozena, and their three children. In a statement, the musician said: ""I am delighted that I will continue in my role as music director of the Orchestra for another three years, extending my contract until 2023, and that I will be able to remain closely associated with the orchestra into the future. ""My reasons for accepting the role of Chief Conductor in Munich are entirely personal, enabling me to better manage the balance of my work and be close enough to home to be present for my children in a meaningful way.  ""I love the London Symphony Orchestra. I remain committed to the LSO, and we have plans for major projects in the coming years. I am thrilled that we will be making music together far into the future."" The conductor is already scheduled to play three concerts with the BRSO in March 2021. It is believed he was their first choice to succeed Jansons, who helmed the orchestra for 16 years before his death in December 2019 from a long-standing heart condition. News of Sir Simon's appointment first appeared in the German and Austrian press over the weekend, before being confirmed by the London Symphony Orchestra on Monday morning. The BRSO added that the musician had signed an initial five-year contract, posting photos of the moment on Twitter. The orchestra's director, Ulrich Wilhelm, said the company was ""delighted"" to welcome Sir Simon aboard, praising his ""passion, artistic versatility and winning charisma"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter According to The Times, one of the main reasons for Sir Simon's departure was the declining prospect of a new concert hall being built for the LSO in London. Shortly before joining the orchestra in 2015, Sir Simon told the BBC that London's concert halls were not up to international standards. When he took up the post, it was reported that the City of London Corporation's offer to build a new Centre for Music was a deciding factor. However, in that same BBC interview, Sir Simon noted that Munich, which will become his new home, does not have a ""proper music hall"" where ""orchestras can flourish"". His predecessor spent a large portion of his career campaigning for a new, Â£100m concert hall in the city. Sir Simon was born in Liverpool and studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He made his Proms debut in 1976 and his opera debut in 1977 at the Glyndebourne Festival. Between 1980 and 1998, he made his name at the helm of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. He was knighted in 1994. He also appeared at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, where he and the LSO were upstaged by Mr Bean while playing the theme to Chariots of Fire. By Will Gompertz, arts editor Sir Simon Rattle's decision to step down as the Music Director of the London Symphony Orchestra will be seen as a significant loss to the UK's classical music scene, and a major blow to the proposed creation of a new world-class Music Hall in London.  It is not all bad news, though. Sir Simon won't be leaving to take up his new post as the Chief Conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich until 2023, having extended his contract in London for an additional 12 months. Thereafter, he will retain a close working relationship with the LSO, acting as its Conductor Emeritus, the first person to fulfil that role since AndrÃ© Previn.  The Berlin-based conductor cites family reasons for his departure, which is understandable given he has three school-age children. But his frustrations with British politics is also likely to have played a part in his decision. He has been vocal in his disappointment about Brexit, passionate in his advocacy for more resources to be made available for the teaching of music in schools, and dismayed by what he considers inadequate support for musicians during the pandemic.  In short, from what he has said to me in the recent past, he thinks Germany is a more conducive place to make world class music. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Coronation Street actor finds 4ft royal python on toilet seat," A Coronation Street actor said he was left ""dreaming of snakes"" after he found a 4ft (1.2m) royal python sitting on his toilet seat.  Harry Visinoni, who plays Seb Franklin in the TV soap, went to brush his teeth on Saturday when he saw the reptile ""staring at him"" in his home in Hale.  It is thought the snake had slithered off from its previous owner and into a wall cavity, said the RSPCA. The charity has named it Lulu, which it said seemed ""appropriate"". After seeing the reptile curled up in his bathroom, Mr Visinoni ran out and called for his girlfriend Ellie Isaac.  Opening the door briefly, the couple ""watched as the snake then slithered on to the top of the toilet and sat on the seat just staring at us"".  After discussing what they should do, they returned but found the python had disappeared.  The pair then spent a ""sleepless"" night ""dreaming about snakes"", before calling the RSPCA in the morning.  Animal rescue officer Sonia Hulme arrived and eventually located the snake behind the bathroom radiator. According to the RSPCA, the royal python is a fairly docile species but can bite when threatened. And although the animal was ""quite feisty"", she managed to catch it using a pillowcase. ""I thought it was quite apt that this royal python was found on the throne - and as she is a female we thought it would be appropriate to call her Lulu."" Ms Hulme said it was likely Lulu had escaped from her previous owner and lived in the wall cavity of the flat.  Snakes can often survive with long gaps between meals, she added. Lulu is now in the care of a specialist reptile keeper at the RSPCA and is in ""good condition"". Actor Harry Visinoni has starred in Coronation Street since October 2016 as builder Seb, the son of mechanic Abi Franklin.

Michael Apted: TV documentary pioneer and film-maker dies aged 79," Film director Michael Apted, best known for the Up series of TV documentaries following the lives of 14 people every seven years, has died aged 79. He also directed Coal Miner's Daughter, Gorillas In The Mist and the 1999 Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. The original 7 Up in 1964 set out to document the life prospects of a range of children from all walks of life. The show was inspired by the Aristotle quote ""give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man"". The first 7 Up show was followed by 14 Up at the start of the next decade, which interviewed the same children as teenagers - and the pattern was set right up until 63 Up in 2019. Throughout all those intervening years ITV viewers became engrossed with the stories of private school trio Andrew, Charles and John, of Jackie who went through two divorces, of Nick who went from jobless and homeless to Liberal Democrat councillor, and of working class chatterbox Tony, whose life ambition was to become a jockey. Apted: '7 Up needed more girls' Apted's shows - which won three Bafta awards - have often been described as the forerunner of modern-day reality TV series, giving its participants the time to tell their own stories on screen.  But unlike their modern counterparts, the original Up children tended to fade away from the limelight in the seven years between each chapter.  In 2008, Apted was made a companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to the British film and television industries. Thomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, said Apted was a ""fearless visionary"" whose legacy would live on. He said Apted, who was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, ""saw the trajectory of things when others didn't and we were all beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication"". ITV's managing director Kevin Lygo said the director's six-decade career was ""in itself truly remarkable"". He said the Up series ""demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition"". ""The influence of Michael's contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed,"" Lygo added. Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, producers of the James Bond film franchise, said Apted ""was a director of enormous talent"" and ""beloved by all those who worked with him"". ""We loved working with him on The World Is Not Enough and send our love and support to his family, friends and colleagues,"" they said. A post on the Twitter account of the band Garbage, who performed the theme for The World Is Not Enough, labelled Apted a ""delightful, charming soul"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter Composer David G Arnold, who composed the Bond theme and worked with Apted on three other non-Bond movies, said he felt ""lucky"" to work with him. ""A more trusting, funny, friendly and, most importantly, kind, person you'd never meet. So pleased to have known him and so sad that he's gone,"" Arnold wrote on Twitter.",BBC News - Entertainment & Arts,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 22:32:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55597263
Dame Barbara Windsor's funeral held with 'Queen Peggy' tribute," The funeral of EastEnders and Carry On actress Dame Barbara Windsor has taken place in London. Ross Kemp, who played her on-screen son in the soap, was among the 30 mourners and gave a reading, as did actor and friend Christopher Biggins. Dame Barbara died in December at the age of 83, having had dementia. There were floral arrangements spelling Babs, The Dame and Saucy, and a mock pub sign showing her as The Queen Peggy in the style of the soap's Queen Vic. Dame Barbara played pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than two decades. Scott Mitchell, who was married to Dame Barbara for 20 years, was joined at Golders Green Crematorium by family and friends including comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams. ""As Covid has denied so many of Barbara's family, friends and fans a chance to say farewell properly, I wanted to share the order of service to let people be a small part of it,"" Mr Mitchell told the PA news agency. ""My heart goes out to every family who have experienced the same restrictions at their loved ones' funerals."" He added: ""I would again like to thank my family, friends, the media and the public for their incredible support and well wishes since Barbara's passing."" Dame Barbara's coffin was brought into the crematorium to sound of Frank Sinatra's On The Sunny Side Of The Street, and the service featured a recording of Sparrows Can't Sing from the actress's 1963 film of the same. It finished with the famous topless photo of Dame Barbara from the film Carry On Camping, alongside her quote: ""That picture will follow me to the end."" Long-time friend Anna Karen, who played Dame Barbara's on-screen sister Aunt Sal in EastEnders, also paid tribute during the service. The funeral was also attended by Loose Women's Jane Moore and EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick. However, the numbers were limited due to coronavirus social distancing. Alzheimer's Research UK recently said it had seen a spike in donations since Dame Barbara's death, and a JustGiving page set up as a tribute to her and in aid of the charity has raised more than Â£150,000 (including Gift Aid). Mr Mitchell said that was ""beyond anything we may have dreamed of"". Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Rapper Pa Salieu wins BBC Sound of 2021: 'I am the voice of the voiceless'," Rapper Pa Salieu has won BBC Music's Sound of 2021 - identifying him as Britain's most exciting musical talent thanks to his adventurous, infectious tracks with hard-hitting lyrics about life and death on the ""frontline"" in Coventry. In topping the Sound of 2021 list, Pa Salieu follows in the footsteps of previous winners like Adele, Ellie Goulding and Michael Kiwanuka. He knows the headlines could have been different, however. ""If I died last year,"" he begins, reflecting on how he was shot in the head outside a pub in his home city in 2019. ""If I actually died - in their eyes, I would be a criminal.""  That's how he believes he would have been perceived by the authorities, the press and the outside world. ""'Gang related. Drive-by shooting.' Trust me, the whole perception would be different right now. You would have never heard of me. If you do hear of me, it's, 'That's that kid that died.' 'Gun crime.' 'These foolish youths.' No."" The life Salieu talks and raps about is murky and precarious. He has been in trouble with the law, arrested six years ago for possessing a knife - for his defence, he insists. ""Police used to say I'm in a gang. I wasn't in a gang. I was never in a gang. Because I used to try to survive? I got caught with a knife when I was 17? What, because I'm paranoid of the streets?  ""I got shot in the head. People get killed every day for no reason where I'm from. I don't expect no-one to understand."" Forty years after The Specials' Ghost Town painted Coventry as a city in decline, Salieu raps about it as ""COV, #CityOfViolence"". But he now wants to be the voice for those who could not make it out, like the two close friends who were killed. ""Our voices count,"" he says. Salieu's debut mixtape Send Them To Coventry - named after the saying for deliberately ostracising or marginalising someone - can also be life-affirming. Now 23, he was born in Slough, then spent six years of his childhood in The Gambia before being sent to Coventry at the age of eight. His fresh voice has a lilt that serves to soften the edges of the stories he tells. Musically, he has more depth and guile than most two-dimensional hip-hop pretenders. His smart wordplay is delivered against an inventive range of backdrops, from the slowed-down siren of Frontline - the song that started to build his buzz early last year - to the soft slow-jam synths of More Paper. ""He has a unique perspective on Britain,"" says BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, who was among the 160 tastemakers who voted for Sound of 2021. ""His songs are exquisitely produced, with enough restraint for Pa's voice to shine through and have the space to tell the stories of his life. They are stories of friendship and family, of violence, exclusion and racism, and they act as timeless evidence of British street life at the turn of new decade."" Read the full interview with Pa Salieu below. What is BBC Sound of 2021? Around 160 tastemakers voted for their favourite new acts, with the artists then ranked according to the number of votes cast.The tastemakers included DJs, music critics and TV, radio and web producers, plus artists including Billie Eilish, Stormzy, Foals, Charli XCX and AJ Tracey.A longlist of 10 was announced in December, with the top five revealed this week.Previous winners include Celeste, Sigrid, Years & Years, Sam Smith, Michael Kiwanuka, Ellie Goulding and Adele.Find out more about the Sound of 2021 How has 2020 been for you? 2020's been sick. It's just been a year of taking life in. I'm excited for next year and what's to come, and 2020 has given me the chance to see the light. The light's there but I'm still in that tunnel. Your auntie is a folk singer in The Gambia - did she inspire you to get involved in music? She's always been around and she goes to so many Gambian and Senegalese events. Folk music is part of your past and who you are. Back home, that's what it means. But me getting into music was out of nowhere. I just saw a studio and fell in love with it. I was like, ""Woah, I like how my voice sounds in this."" I could basically make my voice into an instrument.  You were sent to Coventry when you came back from The Gambia? Straight to Coventry, yeah. Straight to the trenches. What was it like - why do you call it the trenches? Gambia is sick. I was born in England but my first language is technically Wolof. In Gambia, I learned who I am and what I am. My history, my culture. In England, I learned what life is. This is real life. Two different kinds of lessons. I feel like I'm lucky. Was it a shock to come to Coventry? Yeah. In Coventry, Hillfields is a hood. It's the gutter in that area. Since Gambia I was sent straight to Hills and [went] nowhere else. Watching the ends [streets] change, watching the years go by, nothing really changed. The violence just went worse. More youth clubs closed down. Survival - that's what I learned in Hillfields. I didn't see crackheads or crack-fiends like that in Gambia. When I was a kid going to school [in Coventry], you have to pass fiends. You have to pass night workers. It was the morning, but night workers were still about, you know what I'm saying? Never did I know most of my friends were going to turn into crackheads, most of my friends are going to die from the circumstances of the ends. That's what I learned here. Real life. You know what I'm saying? Being shot must have been terrifying. Actually it's less painful than getting stabbed. It's shocking not knowing if you're going to live or not. That's when it's shocking.  I was just trying not to close my eyes. It's scary but it's the weirdest feeling I've ever had. I was more focused on the blood coming out. Has that changed you? Nah. A lot of stuff to open my eyes has happened way before that. The music, I had to get serious with it after my best friend got killed. Then a few months after, my other best friend got killed. Everything I've learned back home is embedded in me, everything I've seen here is embedded in me. Trust me, I should be strong regardless of that gunshot or anything. It's another eye-opener. I've been shot at, but it's never actually hit me until that moment. It's just normal. All I can do is look forward, as always. Why did somebody want to shoot you? I don't know. People get shot every day. Wrong place, wrong time. People hate on you. It's the hood. It's different. It is a treacherous world, believe it or not. Very treacherous. People die for no reason every day. It's life. The thing that matters is what you're going to do with it - let it eat you up, or rise above it? Getting shot is the same as getting fired from your job. What are you going to do with it? Rise up, or what? That's life. Everything is a lesson. You said you got serious about music after what happened to your friends - is that because you decided you had to do something with your life? I always say, either break down or make it out. There are so many friends that have lost their life, turned into crackheads or [been] in prison for a very long time. Their voices ain't going to be heard like that. I'm going to be the voice of that as much as I can. That's my intention. Hood representative. No-one can understand what we've been through. But I know a lot of people who've been through what I've been through, or coming from where I'm coming from, can relate to that. That's their voices. So many voices can't be heard. It's so sad. I am the voice. And that spurs you on? Yeah. My best friend had a clothing line called Money Moves before he died. You see why I hit music even more after he died, because he was one of the first people to try to do something. He went and printed his own shirts. Started it. We all started helping, pushing it. When I started music, he pushed me the most. Is there a message you want to send with your music? Build. Unity. That's what we lack. Where I come from, we lack compassion. It's going to have to come from me. I'm not a punchline artist. Everything I say is exactly how I feel and exactly what I see and exactly where I'm coming from. My message is just build, build, build. Break down or make it out. Protect your energy. Protect everything. 2. Radio-friendly singer-songwriter Holly Humberstone3. Twilight troubadour Berwyn4.

Simple, spiritual, kind-hearted. That's all that you need in life. You can be the richest or the maddest businessman in the world - you need pure vibes, that's what counts. Coventry is UK City of Culture in 2021. Is it a good place to make music? It just needs more opportunity. There's so much talent. Different kinds of music, different cultures infused with their lives. But it lacks opportunity, which we need to push, which we will push. Do you know Coventry's musical history, people like The Specials? Yeah, my best friend that got killed, his granddad was Neville Staple, he was in The Specials. [Staple's grandson Fidel Glasgow was stabbed to death in 2018.] I knew his granddad used to make music but I never knew the powers of it. Then he just died. So it's not a joke. His name has to live on. What are you aiming for in 2021? I aim for progression. Just building, still. I'm so laid-back, bro. I work every day - I ain't slept for the last five days - but I'm so laid back as in I don't pressure myself.

BBC Sound of 2021: Holly Humberstone wants her lyrics to be tattoo-worthy," Holly Humberstone has high standards. When the 21-year-old sits down to write her emotionally-captivating pop songs, she doesn't just want them to be memorable. She wants them to be indelible. ""When we were writing, we said that if a lyric isn't painfully honest and really brutal, then it can't be on the song,"" she says.  ""That's what I aim for: If it doesn't look like a really dodgy, tattoo-on-the-arm lyric, then it doesn't go on."" So far, no-one's actually inked one of her songs onto their wrist (""obviously I'm doing something wrong,"" she laughs) but it won't be long. Humberstone's sparse arrangements and effortless vocals focus your attention on those lyrics - a mixture of acutely-observed detail and conversational asides. ""You never smoked this much before we met,"" she sings on the recent single, Falling Asleep At The Wheel, raking over the embers of a dying relationship. ""Don't know how I got you in such a mess."" On the forthcoming single Scarlett, she captures the messy imperfection of a teenage friendship in one line: ""We go together / Like bad British weather / On the one day I made plans."" Born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, she was encouraged to be creative by her parents - both doctors - who banned TV in the house so she would make up songs from poetry books. While she was still at school, she uploaded songs to her local BBC Introducing show, and made her radio debut a week later. That led to an appearance at Glastonbury, where she was spotted by Lewis Capaldi - who invited her on tour at the start of 2020. Although Covid ruined her plans for the rest of the year, she's amassed more than 65 million streams for her debut EP, and has just come second on the BBC's Sound Of 2021 - which aims to predict the most exciting new music for the coming year. She talked to BBC News about her early ""crap"" songs, finding her sound and living in a haunted house.

Congratulations on making the BBC Sound of 2021 list. After a year of being stuck at home, does any of this feel real? Not really, no. So far, my whole career feels like it has been over social media. I've never done a headline show or anything like that, so I'm really looking forward to being able to play live again in a few months. Just before lockdown, you supported Lewis Capaldi at Wembley. What was that like? I didn't expect to be doing Wembley. I was booked for the Europe leg of the tour - and I was terrified because I'd gone from playing to 200 people to 12,000 in the space of a month or two.  Wembley happened when the American support act couldn't come over because of Covid. I was like, ""Fine. If you're forcing me, I'll do it!"" ""But I'll need a bigger dressing room and 10 puppies."" Yeah. And I want bottles of champagne and stuff like that! But it was so cool: Doing a tour like that made me realise just how badly I wanted that for myself. And then, of course, Covid struck... How did you spend the rest of 2020? It was really hard at first. There's nothing inspiring about being stuck inside. And I put a lot of pressure on myself, because everyone else was like, ""Oh brilliant, loads of time to write, we're going to come out with so much stuff at the end of lockdown"".   But after a few weeks I was like, ""Okay, I've just got to chill and use the time to my advantage"". And I've actually had loads of fun writing on my own and not having too many people tell me what to do! You moved back in with your parents and sisters. How did that go - because when I was 20, going home was wonderful for about two weeks and then I'd be like, ""would you all just leave me alone."" Oh my gosh, definitely. At the start it was like that. I've got a big family, with lots of strong opinions - there's four girls and we're all really close in age and there's lots of stubbornness.  But actually, because the world was in a state of crisis, it ended up being a really special family time - having my mum's home-cooked meals and sleeping in my own bed. It's pretty nice set-up! So, for people who only know of Grantham as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher  - what was it like growing up there? It's a really, really rural part of England. Quite old fashioned and feudal. But I had a really lovely childhood because we're in this really old, freezing cold, falling down house about 20 minutes out of town; and my parents always encouraged us to be creative. My dad's obsessed with poetry, and he used to put little poetry books in front of me - like Leonard Cohen or TS Eliot. I didn't understand anything they were talking about, but I used to make up little songs to them.  Then I started off writing kind of crap songs [of my own], and parents were like, ""Oh, this is great, she's doing something creative!"" And somehow I ended up doing my hobby as a job. What were those early crap songs like?  They were, like, seven-year-old me writing about boys I fancied at school. I'm always finding the notebooks around the house and they're so cringey. It's hilarious. Your first break came from BBC Introducing in Nottingham. What were your hopes when you submitted your songs? I guess I hoped that this would happen - but I never really thought it would! I went to an all-girls school and it was very focused on languages and science. People didn't think music was a real job - and fair enough, it's rural Lincolnshire, you know? But one of my friends' dads heard my music and he was like, ""You should send this to BBC Introducing"".  I'd never heard of it before - but I uploaded some songs in summer 2017 and that same week, [BBC Introducing presenter] Dean Jackson in Nottingham was like, ""Come in for a session!"" I had this, like, big brick keyboard that we spent ages shoving into the lift for my first filmed session. And I've had so much support since then from BBC Introducing in the east Midlands and in Lincolnshire. I'm really grateful for all of it. That was 2017 - but you didn't put out your debut EP 'til last year. So what happened in between? It was a really long process. I knew I could write songs and sing but I didn't really know what my sound was, so I started doing co-writes. I think that process is pretty standard - you go and meet a load of people and a lot of the time they're, like, 40-year-old men. I found that process really hard because I find it difficult to be vulnerable with someone I don't have much in common with.  And then I met this guy Rob Milton, who used to be in a band called Dog Is Dead, who I really loved when I was growing up. I remember writing Falling Asleep At The Wheel [with him] and being like, ""Ah, this is the lightbulb moment"".   That lyric is such a perfect metaphor for sleepwalking through a relationship. Do you remember how it came to you? I had the first line - ""You never smoked this much before we met"" - and I'd taken it to a few sessions where people were like, ""meh."" But when I took it to Rob, he said, ""That's so good. That's an opening line to something"".   I wanted to sing about this relationship I was going through that had lost its spark - and one of the notes I'd written on my phone said ""falling asleep at the wheel"". So that was a really fun time. I love that song. Why do you think so many people have fallen for your lyrics? Being exposed to poetry might have something to do with it - but also, I don't keep a diary, so my songs are my way of working through confusing feelings of growing up and being young. Writing a song clears my head and helps everything make sense. So I think that's maybe why people are connecting with it - because it's just universal stuff I'm going through. Deep End is another song that stands out. Am I right that it was written about one of your sisters, when she was going through a difficult time? Yeah, that's right. I find conversations about mental health really hard, so that song was sort of my way of speaking to my sister and telling her that I don't always understand what she's going through, but I'm always here.  It was a bit of a hopeless feeling at the time but I think after writing it, it was a weight off my shoulders - and she really loved it, as well. And then your sisters got to spray you down with hoses in the video... That was so much fun to film because we did it just outside my house. But it was filmed in January and, if you look on YouTube, there's so many comments saying, ""Her pupils are massive, she must be on pills"". And honestly, it's just because I was freezing cold! I was literally at the end of my capacity! Your next single is called Haunted House... is that about your family home? Yeah! Is it really haunted? I think it must be. My best friend Scarlett, her mum has an antique shop and she's really superstitious - and when she came here, she said that there were ghosts around. It makes sense because it's such an old house and people have definitely died here. But they must be nice ghosts because this house is such a big part of my soul.  What does a nice ghost do? Looks after you and watches over you, I guess. Do they reshelve all the books in alphabetical order? No. No, they didn't do that. This house is a tip.

"Berwyn's breakthrough songs of 'blood, sweat and tears'"," Two years ago, Trinidad-born, London-based singer and rapper Berwyn was sleeping on a mattress on a bare floor when he decided he had a choice. Either he would go all-out to try to make a go of music, or he would give up. What followed was a two-week burst of intense creativity during which he poured his heart into a collection of achingly personal songs about struggling to balance heartache with hope. ""Blood, sweat and tears,"" he says. Fast-forward to October 2020, and those intimate songs became his debut album Demotape/Vega. They have also earned him a record deal with Sony, and now third place on the BBC Sound of 2021 list, which is being revealed this week. Berwyn's blend of haunting hip-hop and downbeat R&B puts him in the company of singers like James Blake and Sampha. For an appearance on the BBC's Later... With Jools Holland in June, he recorded his song Glory in front of his mum in the kitchen, adding an extra verse about racism in response to Black Lives Matter. His music has even accompanied poet Michael Rosen on Newsnight, and his latest single Vinyl proves his songs can be both heartfelt and hook-filled. Berwyn Du Bois moved from Trinidad and Tobago to Romford, east London, at the age of nine. There, his school music teacher took him under her wing - and to folk clubs (evidence exists of a young Berwyn at one such club performing an impressive Ed Sheeran cover). Much of the rest of his life story is laid out in the lines of his songs - his thwarted attempt to go to university, his mum's spell in jail and his struggles to survive. He makes poetry out of violence (""Bodies drop like flies/Bonnies wanting Clydes/Clydes dying long before their times""), homelessness (""How come sleeping in a car only filled me with drive/It was just me, myself, the stars and my guitar in the night""), and his dreams of escape (""When I close my eyes, I see stadium lights""). He talked to BBC News about the obstacles he has faced and his dreams for the future - from becoming the next Dr Dre to being prime minister of Trinidad. Greentea Peng takes fourth placeBedroom pop star Griff comes fifthWatch performances and find out more about the longlistWhat happened to the class of 2020? What happened a couple of years ago to give you such a burst of creativity? I felt as though I had two options - plan A and plan B, and I might as well try the plan A, and just try as hard as you can. I actually ended up making the decision further to that to still go to the plan B anyway. I was going to go home and give up. And then a friend of mine, my previous manager, ended up calling and saying that he'd heard the music from a friend of a friend of a friend, and that I should hang around and we'll do stuff with it, and that was the beginning of a very long story. So what does it mean now that, according to your Spotify Wrapped, you had two million streams in 92 countries in 2020? Apparently there were 59 people who listened to me [more than anyone else]. I know I am at the bottom building up. But it's trippy. Fifty-nine people listened to me more than anybody else. Bon Jovi! Jimi Hendrix! Drake! There are huge names that have existed! That is a trip beyond trips. How did you get into making music? In year 11, we gained a really, really good teacher. She was so invested and so committed to making sure our future was sound. She really went the extra mile. There was one computer and I would sit on that computer any time I had the chance. After school I was on it from three o'clock, when school finished, till seven in the evening sometimes, and she would sit there on her computer finding something to do just so I could be up there. That level of commitment - oh my God. None of this was existing without it.  What's her name? Di Russell. Those are the little things that make such a crucial difference. She understood the importance of keeping me distracted in the right ways. We used to go to this folk club on a Wednesday evening. These people would show me so much love. That's a special woman. Shout out Di. So did you get into folk? I am still. I'm a storyteller myself. That's folk, isn't it? It's a tale, even if it's a fictional tale or a tale of some battle that happened, it's all storytelling. Your Spotify biography talks about getting great grades but not being allowed to go to uni. They were more than good enough. I wasn't allowed to go to uni. Immigration matters. Political issues. Surely there are loads of kids out there right now with that problem and I think about them all the time. And it made being in school very futile. I remember sitting in the exam halls and feeling the futility in it, but doing it anyway. Kind of stupid. In hindsight, kind of not. What path did that put you on? It put me on a path away from my friends and very much by myself because I couldn't go to uni. There's a psychological repercussion to that - a lack in growth and experience. Also I wasn't allowed to earn a living at the time so I could do what I could to make a living, so life wasn't the easiest thing to do when the day came. But in hindsight I'm grateful and thankful for every single day still. That biog also says you're ""grateful to have had the chance to be at the VERY bottom of the pile"". Is that how it felt? I knew I was at the very bottom of the pile. I don't need to express all the political reasons, but that wasn't something I was under the assumption of, that was something I was under the political enforcement of. In Glory, you sing about wanting to go from making sandwiches for doctors in Subway to being the next Dr Dre.  I worked in a Subway in the hospital, so I served 80% doctors on a daily basis. Is that your aim, to reach the heights of Dr Dre? The next Dr Dre? Dr Dre couldn't sing. Better than Dr Dre? I wouldn't make a very convincing Dr Dre either - I'm tiny. In terms of my overall ambitions, if there's anything I see at the end of the tunnel, if it were to exist, I plan to be prime minister of Trini one day. I am going to be prime minister of Trini. I've been saying that since I was like 17 years old. It's always been my job, I just haven't taken it yet. It's not even that I'm in love with politics or anything like that. I'm in love with Trinidad. It must be a big part of you. Especially with the situations I've had to go through, I think it was a hugely important factor, having a psychological home. At least an identity that leads back to a place. A sense of yourself. Why did you perform Glory for Later... With Jools in the way you did? We just thought a wholesome approach would suit the record we were playing. And also there was a slight juxtaposition, the world was almost burning down at the time. It was weird, it was the biggest moment of my life and then I'm this dirty thing when I scroll through my phone, and I'm this promised thing when I play the keyboards. I just had so many worlds to live in, so I decided to write that third verse - the slightly controversial one. When you sing about stuff you've been through, does it help you process it? It's quite weird, the fact that you take your pain, you put it on paper, you go over here and you make a beat and then all of a sudden you can dance to the thing that had you crying in bed yesterday, and you will never cry about it again. It's a weird medicine thing and you didn't even know it existed until the day you tasted it. There's no better therapy, I don't think. Have you got lots more music that you've written since the album? Unfortunately I'm fortunate to be blessed with the curse of having so many songs. But it's nice. It can never be a problem really but it's hard to not feel like a problem. I've put my foot on writing songs for a bit. We're sitting on 150 plus, a ridiculous amount of songs. We've just got to make an album out of that. Maybe two. Are the newer songs different from what's on the album? In terms of the sounds I've been exploring, I've been ambitious and really approaching hit status quality. Just being ambitious and saying, I know I'm not good enough, but I'm going to try to be. And you get there in the end, right?",BBC News - Entertainment & Arts,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:49:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55274241
Greentea Peng: From 'beach town rock star' to the world," It was at a tequila-fuelled, open-mic jam night in Mexico four years ago that Aria Wells rediscovered her voice. The free-spirited Londoner had pretty much given up on singing and songwriting during a ""reckless"" period in her teens - and was instead documenting her travels under the online pseudonym Greentea Peng. She was actually working on a yoga retreat on the night she found the (Dutch) courage to join a live band, treating the barflies of beachside Tulum to a cover of Lily Allen's Smile... Although it could just as easily have been an Amy Winehouse number, the now 26-year-old recalls hazily. ""I was actually sitting on my own, just drunk, coming out of a really dark phase of my life mentally, and in this really magical place,"" says Wells. ""There was just that [sod] it feeling of, 'Let me get up and sing a song'. And I did and I just loved it, man. I hadn't done it in years, it just felt amazing. ""Then the guitarist was like, [adopts deeper voice] 'Hey girl, you know we need a singer in our band?' I was like, 'Sweet', and the next day we were practising Arctic Monkeys and Black Sabbath songs."" Within two weeks, her new band (the aptly-monikered Los Hedonistas) were booked to play at all the bars and hotels in town. ""I've gone from having no money - I literally had like Â£900 to last me a year - to earning pesos every night and getting free drinks and food,"" she says. ""I was like, 'I could get used to this: Beach town rock star!'"" Between trips home to the UK and back out to Mexico to perform with the band, Wells started penning the tunes that would wind up on her 2018 debut solo EP. A savvily-mixed cocktail of psychedelic soul, R&B, hip-hop, dub and reggae, Greentea Peng's music soon went viral thanks to a Colors Show video for her song, Downers. Fast forward to 2020 and the singer shone, just as she did in that Mexican bar, resplendent with her facial tattoos and piercings,  on her TV debut. This time, in the more grandiose setting of a chandeliered, socially-distanced episode of Later... with Jools Holland. Speaking via video call from her new home in the European countryside, Wells told us all about her loco journey from Latin America to fourth place on the BBC Sound of 2021 list - which aims to highlight the most promising music talent for the coming year. Bedroom pop artist Griff takes fifth placeSee the full BBC Sound of 2021 listWhat happened to the class of 2020?'Incredible, stunning' singer Celeste is the Sound of 2020 Hey Aria. Congratulations on making the top five! Where does music start for you? I've been singing from as young as I can remember. My dad was very musical, he was a trained actor, very theatrical, and would always take me to theatre auditions and teach me Oliver Twist songs. I loved Oliver Twist as a kid. Then [there was] always school and church choir stuff. But I stopped [singing] at about 14/15. I'd started writing my own songs and I was performing but  I got to a point where I said, ""You know what? I don't actually want to do this any more."" And so I spent about seven years not doing anything actually - just partying and being a reckless teenager. It wasn't until I moved to Mexico, [and did] lots of soul searching, and came to lots of realisations... Watching bands every day playing, musicians just on the street drumming and dancing and singing. It properly woke something up in me, like, ""Oh, you've got to start singing again, man"". How did you come up with the name Greentea Peng? I was in Peru, travelling, I was about 18, and I was high as hell [cannabis is legal in Peru]. I go into this chemists and this tea box is just shining at me. I'm like, ""What is that?"" I go up to it and it's this bosh box of green tea - my favourite kind of green - covered in leaves and there's just this woman's body cut out with a weed bikini and it said Green Tea Seng. I was like, ""Greentea Peng!"", because the girl was peng. You might have to explain what peng means for some of our readers. Oh yeah! Just kind of like tasty, good, buff. You first came to a wider audience with your dazzling performance on Jools Holland. What was that like? I loved it, I'm not gonna lie. Jools Holland was something I wrote down at the beginning of my career, which I manifested. The band [her own UK one, not Los Hedonistas] were just so gassed because everyone wants to do it. And it went really well. Obviously it was different, it's not the live show or anything, but I loved the venue. The band were amazing and we were just all so excited to be there. I wasn't 100% happy with my performance, I thought I could have done better. I could hear my nerves and my excitement coming out in my vocals, but in the end I was like, ""You know what? It's all part of it"". I'm just grateful and happy to have done it. Well, your nerves did not come across on the TV. The lyrics to that song, Hu Man are quite philosophical and dare I say, even spiritual? You seem deeply connected to your music. I'm definitely on a journey. I never thought I was going to be a singer. I'm not making music to be recognised as a singer. It's been a by-product of it that that has happened. I'm literally doing my healing process in front of everyone because every song I'm writing is just me going through the works, I'm not making anything up. I'm travelling from this place and I'm trying to get to this place. And I'm reading books, I'm experiencing life, I'm going through pain and I'm going through trials and tribulations and I'm happy, and I'm down, you know what I mean?  I understand it does come across but I don't describe my music as spiritual, because I wouldn't want to ever put myself where people think that I'm this, you know... I don't know what it is, it's just me. Along the way you also appeared on The Streets latest album, and in their brilliant lockdown music video. It looked like you were all in a computer game. We did that over Zoom! Oh mate, that was sick. I don't normally get gassed really about anything. I try not to be too attached to bad feelings or good feelings, but when Mike [Skinner] hollered at me and said, ""I want you to be on the album"" - that's recognition from a real G. He's totally his own thing, I see him as a poet. And I love that because I don't necessarily see myself as a singer or a rapper. I'm kind of more like a commentator or, I don't know... I was really excited and, obviously, when I met him, he's exactly how I thought he would be. Just super cool, chatting as if we were mates from [a long] time ago. He sent me the beat and I was like, ""I'm gonna do it because it's Mike, innit?!"". At first I was like, ""Am I gonna be able to write anything? This is mental"". You know he did that video himself? He's a super talented guy. Speaking of talented artists, tell us about supporting Neneh Cherry on tour in 2019. She's an OG. She's another artist that's just in a lane of her own. I only really got into her late, kind of the same time I discovered Erykah [Badu]. My mum showed me her quite late compared to some my other musical influences. I remember Buffalo Stance was the first video I watched and just her charisma and the way she's just unapologetically herself, and still is. I was watching her on stage and I was like, ""This woman has got proper energy."" She just does her own thing. It was funny opening her for her, especially in Manchester, because there was a lot of drunk women in the crowd down the front and I came on to open and they were like, ""NENEH!!!"" I was saying on the microphone, ""I'm Greentea Peng. I'm here to open for Neneh and this is my first song, Moonchild"". And they were like, ""MANCHILD!!!"" It was hilarious. Hopefully we'll start to see scenes like that again soon. What else would success look like for you in 2021?  I think the idea of success for me has always been calmness and to feel centred, and to have a kind of steady posture about myself that I can kind of take throughout life, no matter what it throws at me. For instance, you know this coronavirus? At the beginning of the year I nearly lost my mind when this [stuff] kicked off. I fell very deeply down the rabbit hole, and I'm always there anyway, but I went to next levels - I had to bring myself out. I'm doing all of the little bits I need to help me to be able to have that space - moving out of the city, Obviously I want the album [written in 2020 about the events of last year] to go down well. I want people to receive that well and to hear it, it's quite experimental. But in terms of myself, I feel just the sense of calmness and clarity. Finally, tequila aside, do you have any advice for any potential Sound of 2022 wannabes? I would say, be yourself fully. Actually fully believe in yourself. And also, don't strive for anything. Try not to be overly ambitious and fill your head full of desires. Never seek gratification from recognition, do what you're doing because you love to do it, and because there's a higher intention behind it. Stay true to yourself and things that are meant for you will come to you. It's very easy these days to be like, ""OK I don't have a million views on this song so it must be [rubbish], let me go and write"". Nah man, it's not all about numbers. If there's one person that's heard that song and connected with it, that's a prize. Obviously it's hard to survive - you need money, there's no two ways about it. I was working in a bar basically up until just the beginning of last year. In this day and age, you've got social media and you're constantly bombarded with what everyone else is achieving, and it's easy to get wrapped up into this little race. But it's not about that, expression and art, it's about being true to yourself. For me, all I want is to be able to be like Janis Joplin on stage, I mean just wailing, not even having to say any words, being so free and ego-less in my expression. Just delve into the music man, if that's what it's about. Fame and money - everything comes and goes, all of these exterior things. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Griff: Bedroom pop for the broken-hearted," How do you write a song about heartbreak when you've never had your heart broken? For 19-year-old pop singer Griff, the answer is simple: Just look around you. ""There's lots of scenarios where you can experience heartbreak,"" she explains. ""It doesn't have to be romantic.  ""Like if a friend moves away, or you lose a family member. When someone leaves your life, you feel like there's a black hole there."" So, on the moving piano ballad Good Stuff, she sings about missing the foster children who passed through her family's home in Hertfordshire. On Didn't Break It Enough, she's blindsided by the lingering affection for someone who betrayed her. Her sparse, dramatic songs about being a ""hormonal teenager"" have already won her a legion of loyal fans - not least the 160 music critics, DJs and musicians who voted her into fifth place on the BBC Music Sound of 2021 list. Born Sarah Faith Griffiths, she was schooled in soul and gospel music by her Jamaican father and Chinese mother, before falling in love with Taylor Swift's Fearless album when she was eight years old. ""It was such a contrast to all the stuff I'd been brought up on,"" she recalls. ""The pop sensibility, and the fact she was singing about teenage stuff: It was my first memory of realising I loved pop music."" Griff had her first recording session at the age of 10, ""just doing embarrassing things in a band"". By the time she left school, she'd signed a deal with Warner Music, releasing her first single in July 2019, two weeks after she finished her A-Levels. Despite the restrictions of the pandemic, she's already enjoyed a meteoric rise - ending 2020 by soundtracking Disney's Christmas advert, and receiving a personal endorsement from Taylor Swift after recording a cover of Exile, from the star's Folklore album. ""Honestly, this whole year feels super, super-surreal,"" laughs the singer, who calls the BBC from the bedroom where she produces all of her own music (complete with a limited edition Taylor Swift ""Baby Taylor"" guitar on the wall).  ""I still feel like I should be doing my homework."" Read our full interview with Griff below. Bedroom pop and UK rap dominate BBC Sound of 2021 listWhat happened to the class of 2020?'Incredible, stunning' singer Celeste is the Sound of 2020 Hi Griff! Congratulations on being part of the Sound of 2021! Thank you, it's pretty crazy, isn't it? How did you find out? There was another ""ones-to-watch"" list that I didn't make and I was on the phone to my manager going, ""How did we miss this? What did we do wrong?"" and he was like, ""Shhhâ¦ it's fine, we've got the big one."" You started making music when you were still at school. Did your homework suffer? I was actually a very good student! But, especially towards the end of my school career, I was doing my A-Levels in the morning, then travelling into London, doing a studio session, coming back home, doing a quick economics essay, then doing it all over again. It was like a split life I was living. What did your teachers think? Well, they didn't know, but it definitely got to a point in sixth form where they were like, ""OK, everyone has handed in their personal statements [for university] - but Sarah, where's yours?""  I was like, ""Oh miss, I'm going to take a gap year. I won't apply to Uni."" And in the back of my head I was going, ""I've signed a record deal, miss."" When I was doing my A-Levels, I had a show on local radio and my teacher told me to quit because I was ""damaging my future prospects"". My economics teacher said something similar. He's proper safe, I like him, but he was just like, ""Oh Sarah, when are you going to give up this music business and take your economics seriously?"" And then I got an A, and that was a nice middle finger! Ah, so you're not just a musical genius. Well, I'm very competitive. Even when I signed a record deal half-way through sixth form, I knew I wanted to finish my exams and do them well.  At that point, you were going into sessions with much older, more experienced writers and producers. Were you quite self-confident? I don't know. I think, when you're younger, you have less anxiety. You're just optimistic and bubbly and walking into the studio going, ""Oh hi, let me write a big smash hit song!""  So I don't remember it being intimidating. In my head, I knew you had to say yes to everything - and that might open one door at some point. Mirror Talk was one of those stop-you-in-your-tracks debut singles. What made you choose it as your first release? It's not your conventional love song. It's kind of about having melodramatic breakdowns by yourself, and your relationship with yourself, rather than other people. And there's literally two elements in the track - so it was super-sparse and felt different to everything else out there. We put it out literally two weeks after my last exam, and Annie Mac premiered it [on BBC Radio 1]. It was my first ever radio play and, for me, that was like, ""Woah, this is really happening."" Pop music has become a lot braver about tackling mental health, with artists like Halsey and Ariana Grande discussing depression and self-image. That's got to be healthy. Definitely. It makes sense to have songs that tap into what people are really feeling, instead of this inflated, glossy ideal of what we should be feeling. You've been compared to Billie Eilish and Lorde and Taylor Swift. Do you hear those references in your music? Definitely! It's the biggest compliment ever. Lorde is probably my number one inspiration. But it's quite scary to think people would make those comparisons. I feel like I've got impostor syndrome and I've just been winging it until this point.  They're all artists who have made their own sound. Is that your goal, too? I think that's the only way you can make a career that has longevity. I could easily write songs that would do well in the moment - but to create art that feels timeless, you have to carve out your own lane of pop, which means people come to you. So yeah. I'm always trying to do something that's a little bit different. Good Stuff is one of those songs. It doesn't feel like anyone else could have sung it. What's the story behind it? When I went in to write Good Stuff, I had the line ""you left me with the good stuff"" in my notebook. That was about how my family fosters kids. They come to live with us for years and become like brothers and sisters. But they always move on to a more permanent place, and when they do, we don't really see them again. And I think when anyone leaves your life, you only remember the best memories. So that's what that song was about.  My wife and I adopted two children - and we do keep in touch with their foster family, because they're such a big part of their lives. But I know some new parents find that hardâ¦  It's each to their own, really. Sometimes, especially when the kids have spent so much time here, it's kind of like letting your partner see their ex. So I get how there can be insecurities around it. But there's no hard feelings there. Kids need to attach. But definitely as a family, we sit there and reminisce. But it's really hard at points. You miss them loads. To go back to the music - you've done a few songwriting collaborations recently with Zedd and Hailee Steinfeld and Honne. Is that something you want to do more of? I've done a little . It's hard because you don't want to give away your best songs - but I want to do more of it, because it's a nice outlet. Instead of always thinking, ""Does this lyric fit me? Is relevant to where I'm at?"" you can just write for fun.  Have you been in one of those sessions where a singer comes in and unloads all of their personal problems - and says, ""Now, turn that into a song for me!"" Yeah, but I like that! Songwriting is my first love, before being an artist. Just sitting there and decoding what people are saying, then trying to put that into a song that everyone can relate to. I quite enjoy it. Have you got a song or a lyric where you feel you've made that connection? Forgive Myself was a monumental song for me. The lyric in that goes: ""I gave my heart to the wrong somebody else... so I need to forgive myself.""  Again, it wasn't necessarily about love, but I guess being young and being in the  music industry, you trust your dreams to a lot of different people, hoping they can help you, and often it falls short. I beat myself up a lot for trusting the wrong people. So that song felt quite healing. This has been a very strange year for anyone trying to launch a music career. All the things you're supposed to do - concerts, showcases, festivals, TV and radio appearances - have pretty much been off the cards. How have you found it? It's been the best-worst year ever. I've been fortunate in that I've been busy. But I also feel like I'm just sitting in my music room and filming myself. Social media's suddenly much more important. So there's a lot more stuff to do: Influencer kind-of things, that I never thought I'd have to do as a musician. What's the strangest thing you've filmed yourself doing? Ermâ¦ I'm always scrapping for content. Like, I've got to post every other day. And one day my social media team were like, ""Oh, you've got onto Apple's Hottest Songs playlist, you need to post about that. Something funny"".  And before you know it, I'm filming myself trying to fit a whole apple in my mouth. I was like, ""What am I doing? Let's go back to making songs.""  I presume this was a mini Braeburn, not one of the gigantic Hokuto apples? I don't remember. I went to the fridge, picked one up and went for it. Wait, you keep apples in the fridge? I guess we do, yeah. That's interesting. I never consciously put them in the fridge. I live with my mum and she just does it.  Are they better cold? No, because you get tooth freeze.  I'm asking all the important questions here. Of course! I don't know where I stand on cold apples. Let the people know I'm in the middle on that issue. Surely apples are at their best when they're hot and in a pie? Oh, I had a really nice apple pie the other day at the pub. You're right. Let's get back on track... Is it right that you make a lot of your own clothes? I do! I love sewing! Where did that come from? I've always loved clothes and fashion - but I thought everyone did. I thought it was a normal teenage thing. And then in sixth form, I was like, ""Oh no, I think I've got more of a vested interest,"" so I took textiles for A-Level. That's where I learnt the basics and it's followed me since.  For photo-shoots, I've worked with stylists and been dressed in the most expensive clothes but for some reason it doesn't feel like me - so I always end up bringing along pieces I've made and wearing them as well.  What's your signature style? I like playful, oversized, vintage dresses. There's an element of fantasy to everything I make. Will you end up like Lady Gaga, owning a fashion house, churning out the designs and getting other people to make them? I don't know if I'll be quite so Cruella De Vil, getting minions to make everything, but I definitely want to do something in fashion. And when I do, I want it to be proper. It can't be like, ""Oh cute, she's making clothes now"". I want it to be a proper clothing brand statement. What have you got up your sleeve for 2021? Honestly, I'm playing it by ear. I've actually been writing loads over lockdown - maybe a hundred songs - but I never know if they're good or not! Hopefully, I'll release a single in January, and an EP in March or May. How do you choose from 100 songs? I know Carly Rae Jepsen blasts out her demos while she cleans the house... I'm a driver. I like listening to them in the car. And I also send them to my best friend and see which one she's humming the next time I see her.  Before I go, can I ask what's on the CD rack behind you? Oh gosh, no-one's asked me this before. Hang on... [She pulls out a handful of CDs]  Oh, they're all empty! Ah - but look at this: Nicki Minaj, Pinkprint! I love that album. And then there's a load of old-school Christian music, because that's what my parents listened to back in the day. Did you sing in the church choir when you were younger? Yeah! I'm still really involved in church - but it's not a traditional one. It's in a big theatre and there's modern music and lights -and they put on huge events at the O2 and Wembley, so I've got a lot of live experience, in a way. What can we expect from a Griff solo show, if and when concerts start up again? I managed to do a virtual gig at the Tate Modern [in October] and that was a dream come true. We had life-drawers and projectors and proper set design. So I think you can definitely expect a big production and a lot of energy and me going crazy, really, dancing around with a microphone. What are your moves like? Probably quite bad. You can go and have a look on YouTube. I'm not going to recreate them for you now! Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

What the class of Sound of 2020 did next," ""I'm really, really happy,"" said Celeste, as she won the BBC's Sound of 2020 last January.  ""I can't wait now to see what the rest of the year will look like. I'm so thrilled and so excited. I can't wait."" Celeste went on to win the Brits' Rising Star award and soundtrack the John Lewis Christmas advert. But, as we all know, 2020 didn't quite go as planned. So how did the top five acts on the BBC's Sound Of list spend their first year in the spotlight? There were number one albums, missed flights, phone calls with fans and adventures inside arcade machines. Here's what happened... The top five of the Sound Of 2021 will be revealed from Sunday, 3 January Irish rock band Inhaler sold 10,000 tickets for their last tour, squeezing in 21 gigs before lockdown struck in March. After clocking up air miles on trips to America, Japan and Europe, ""we were all secretly looking forward to having some down time at home,"" admits singer Elijah Hewson, ""but our desire for that faded quickly"". ""We've sort of reverted back to when we were still in secondary school, rehearsing in the shed together and just enjoying playing music and being mates. It's really important to us that we stick together during this time and keep being a gang."" Quarantine gave the quartet time to write new material for their debut album - including the politically-driven When It Breaks, which was written as a response to the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests. ""We felt that people were angry, lonely, upset and scared,"" says Hewson. ""The world feels broken, or like it's about to be broken at any minute, and we wanted to write a song that we could dance to in a field somewhere next summer... or the summer after that. ""We're not a very political band. We don't wear our views on our sleeve but we really felt like this was a big moment and as artists how could you not want to say something about it?"" According to the band's Instagram page, the quartet have been out and about in Dublin recently, searching for locations to shoot their album cover. So, does that mean a release is imminent? ""Sworn to secrecy!"" says Hewson. ""We're very excited to talk more about the album when we can - but for now we're still tinkering on it and making it the best it can be. ""We're in no rush, it's not like we've got a show to get to!"" Read last year's interview with Inhaler Joy Crookes' conversational soul songs earned her fourth place in the BBC's Sound of 2020. At the time, the 21-year-old said she'd set a ""self-imposed deadline of May"" to complete her debut album. Needless to say, that didn't happen. Some people in her team caught Covid-19, while Crookes, who already suffered from anxiety, developed ""serious body image issues"". ""It was just a mess."" she says. Drawing on her Bangladeshi-Irish heritage, she chose to prioritise the ""collective as opposed to individual"", insisting that her team travel home to spend time with their families, instead of ""going ahead with this [career] and being a powerhouse for no reason"". She stayed productive though, releasing two singles (including the sublime, Nina Simone-referencing, Anyone But Me) and showcasing new, work-in-progress material on Instagram. ""It's definitely been productive,"" she says. ""Creating a body of work always takes a lot of isolation but that's often overlooked, because people want us for concerts and they want us for interviews. ""I think maybe, potentially, life should be more like this."" Read last year's interview with Joy Crookes His album went to number one. He won MTV's best breakthrough award. Dave Grohl called him the saviour of rock and roll. It's safe to say Yungblud had a pretty good year. ""I can't believe it,"" he beams. ""We're just a team of young people working out of my flat, and we got a number one album! It's so funny."" A punk-pop icon in the making, Yungblud has built his career on an intense and symbiotic relationship with his fans. Lockdown may have meant cancelling tour dates, but the bond only got stronger, thanks to fortnightly fan phone calls, livestreamed gigs and his hugely charismatic TikTok videos. ""I think when we have something to kick against, we thrive,"" he says. ""I wasn't going to abandon my fanbase. When gigs started getting cancelled, I was like, 'Nah, this is not going to fly with me. No matter what, I'm going to be connected to them.' ""When all is said and done, what Yungblud is is a group of people coming together for one common reason. And that's what I believe will make us be around for a long time. The connection is more than just a song, or that we look cool. It's deep-rooted. It's a wire from one heart to another, that pulsates."" That connection is brought to life on Mars, a song that was inspired by a young transgender fan in Maryland, whose parents couldn't accept or understand their daughter's transition. ""She said that all she could do, in her head, was to plan to get her parents to a Yungblud show. Not to see me, not to hear the music, but to see everyone there - and the sense of community and the sense of liberation.  ""And the parents came, and they saw kids like her, and they took her out for a burger and said they accepted her as their baby girl.  ""That makes my head explode. I'm so proud to be a part of something that can do that for someone."" Restless at the best of times, Yungblud is itching to get back out on the road again - with gigs planned for May, lockdown permitting. And he has his sights set even higher in 2022. ""It's not been announced yet, but my plan is to do a massive show like Knebworth or Spike Island. And I want people to come from all over the world. And I want it to become a worldwide movement."" Read last year's interview with Yungblud Earlier this year, Easy Life's Murray Matravers found himself locked inside an amusement arcade ""claw grab"" machine. It was a novel approach to self-isolation... but he had an ulterior motive: shooting a promo photo for the band's breezy, escapist single Daydreams. ""That was definitely my highlight of the year,"" laughs the singer. The song itself was a ""sign of the times"", he adds. Built around a sample of Aretha Franklin's soul classic Daydreaming, it's about, ""wishing you were elsewhere, doing anything other than sat in the flat drinking in the daytime"". It was one of several tracks to emerge from lockdown, as the indie/hip-hop group worked obsessively on their debut album. Finished and mastered last month, Matravers says it's a very different record to the one he'd originally imagined. ""If it had been business as usual, I probably would have had to create the same amount of music in two months instead of 12 - so it really allowed us to finesse the writing, and the production and really obsess about it.  ""I could spend a week making techno, just to see what that was like. That's a luxury that we've never afforded ourselves before. ""And I feel really lucky to have had that - because if there hadn't been the pressure and desire to create an album, I would have had a very different year indeed. I would have really struggled."" Read last year's interview with Easy Life Celeste had just arrived from Los Angeles when she delivered a spell-binding performance at February's Brit Awards.  She planned to spend a couple of days at home, finding the perfect spot to display her Rising Star award before flying back to the US to finish her debut album.  ""And at seven o'clock on Saturday, they announced a travel ban,"" she recalls. ""I thought, 'Maybe this will last a couple of weeks or a month,' and all of a sudden it's December."" The album release was subsequently pushed back - it now comes out in January - but Celeste says she ""hasn't been too disappointed"" by 2020. ""I've been able to adapt to the situation,"" says the singer, whose partnerships with brands like Converse, Sky Sports and Stella Artois ""have actually carried me through the year"".  But it was soundtracking the John Lewis Christmas advert with her song A Little Love that brought her into millions of homes. The 26-year-old was the first artist to be commissioned to write an original song for the campaign - and found herself inspired by the concept of strangers helping strangers.  ""It wasn't only meant to be fantastical and Christmassy. There was this element of realism to it, which is where I always find my inspiration. I wrote it quite quickly"". A Little Love wasn't Celeste's only single of 2020. I Can See The Change was produced by Billie Eilish's brother, Finneas, after they met at the Brits, and the jazzy, piano-thumping Stop This Flame became a top 10 hit in Belgium (""I didn't know that!"", she laughs). But 2020 also gave the singer the opportunity to pause and reassess her songwriting. ""In the last year, I'd only really brought out singles - and singles tend to magnify a very specific part of your personality. It's not always your truest voice. ""Being in solitude helped me to get back in touch with my thoughts and feelings - finding inspiration without it being polluted too much by other people's experiences."" That epiphany inspired the title - and the sound - of her album, Not Your Muse, which was largely written and recorded with her touring band. ""Not Your Muse as an idea, to me, meant that I'm taking charge of who I am and not allowing anybody to taint me too much with their ideas of what they think I should be. ""And I found that true for all sorts of situations,"" she adds. ""Not just work, but personal relationships too."" 2021, watch out: Celeste is a force to be reckoned with.
